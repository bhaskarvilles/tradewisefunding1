Many traders either have a bot in their portfolio, or are at least dabbling with creating one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this article, we\u2019re going to look at how <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2023\/01\/22\/building-a-trading-bot-to-pass-a-prop-firm-challenge\/\">trading bots<\/a> can be used with a prop firm trading account, the benefits, the drawbacks and how to build your own bot! So, let\u2019s get into it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Using An Automated Trading Bot To Pass A Prop Firm Challenge<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>First, it\u2019s important to realise that many prop firms, including <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\">Lux Trading<\/a>, allow traders to use bots in their trading challenges.\u00a0<\/span><span>Typically, the only stipulation is the fact this needs to be your own trading bot, or you have access to the source code. Without this, the trader has no idea what the bot is doing or how it can manage risk &#8211; which will lead to many funded accounts blown.\u00a0<\/span><span>Bots have been successfully used to obtain <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/#howwillyougrow\">funded accounts<\/a> and continue trading on those accounts after challenges have been completed.\u00a0<\/span><span>In all honesty, bots can get some great results and a portfolio of well balanced bots can outperform most manual traders due to their lack of human error, emotion and ability to trade the strategy flawlessly for 24 hours a day. <\/span><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Benefits Of Using A Trading Bot On A Funded Trading Account<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>It may come as no surprise that there is a considerable range of benefits from using a trading bot on your <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/#howwillyougrow\">funded account<\/a>. Let\u2019s take a look at some of them\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a01. No Human Emotion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>The largest benefit, undoubtedly, is the fact the trading bot can just execute your trading parameters with no nuance, no emotion and no errors. <\/span><span>Humans typically make a huge number of errors when trading and let bias shape many of their trades &#8211; resulting in worse trading returns.\u00a0<\/span><span>A bot has no emotions and will just execute the exact same trade over and over again until you turn it off. This is a huge value add to most traders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a02. <\/strong><strong>Back testing Functionality<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>With a trading bot, or portfolio of trading bots, you can easily run a <a href=\"https:\/\/forexbrokerreport.com\/how-to-backtest-a-forex-trading-strategy-full-guide\/\">back test<\/a> over a period of years in minutes.\u00a0<\/span><span>This is hugely valuable as you will know for certain whether your strategy is actually profitable or whether you were playing with luck when you had your winning streak.\u00a0<\/span><span>Not only that, you\u2019re going to have all of your numbers at hand in terms of drawdown and maximum losses over the last few years. This can help you frame your risk management strategy and give yourself a better chance of not losing your funded account by violating the risk parameters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. <\/strong><strong>Ability To Never Miss A Trade<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Life and jobs get in the way for traders, and so does sleep! With a trading bot, it will run whenever you want it to run, meaning you\u2019ll never miss a profitable trade.\u00a0<\/span><span>With that being said, I\u2019d recommend having a think about it only trading during London and New York sessions as the spreads and lack of liquidity may be a problem during Asian hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>4. <\/strong><strong>Ability To Create A Portfolio<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>A human trader will struggle to put 5 strategies on the go at any one time. However, this is easy for a bot to handle.\u00a0<\/span><span>The majority of profitable automated traders will have anywhere between 5 and 10 bots in their portfolio, resulting in less risk and more consistent returns in the market than if you were trading just the 1 strategy endlessly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Drawbacks Of Using A Trading Bot On A Funded Trading Account<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Although there are certainly more positives than negatives, there are a few negatives when it comes to using trading bots that need to be considered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. You Need To Purchase A VPS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>To achieve consistency, you\u2019re going to need to run your bot on some kind of dedicated server, typically a VPS.\u00a0<\/span><span>Although this is tedious, the cost is only going to be around \u00a320 per month for a VPS that can handle 1-5 trading bots, so it\u2019s not too expensive! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a02. <\/strong><strong>Bots Ignore Fundamentals &amp; News Releases<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Your bot will be completely oblivious to any fundamental impacts, news releases and anything else that could affect the price of currency.\u00a0<\/span><span>This could be a blessing or a curse, depending on which way the market moves, of course.\u00a0<\/span><span>Some traders monitor the news and turn their bots off during extreme volatility, so that may be an option for you to consider. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a03. <\/strong><strong>Your Bot May Not Work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>It\u2019s possible that you or the developer has built the bot badly, and it\u2019s taking invalid trades. This should be ironed out during the build process, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind.\u00a0<\/span><span>If you\u2019re taking invalid trades, it\u2019s possible that your returns won\u2019t mirror what you expected at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Building Your Forex Trading Bot<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>So, let\u2019s assume you have a profitable <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2023\/03\/12\/do-forex-trading-strategies-stop-working-over-time\/\">trading strategy<\/a> manually, and you\u2019re looking to automate the strategy.\u00a0<\/span><span>Until more recently, this would involve paying a developer thousands of dollars to create an EA for you that runs on your MT4 or MT5. Although an EA is still the easiest way to get this done, you now have more options at your fingertips, and you can actually <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2023\/01\/22\/building-a-trading-bot-to-pass-a-prop-firm-challenge\/\">build a bot for free<\/a>!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Precursor &#8211; Creating Rules<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>If you want to code a trading bot, you\u2019re going to need to create rules for your strategy. If you need a candlestick to look a certain way, you\u2019ll need to think about that in relation to the surrounding candles, etc.\u00a0<\/span><span>It can take weeks to fine tune your rule set before looking at actually coding the bot, but once done, this will save a huge number of headaches when back testing! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Using No-Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>There are now some great \u2018no-code\u2019 tools available for <a href=\"https:\/\/forexbrokerreport.com\/the-pros-and-cons-of-forex-trading-bots\/\">creating trading bots<\/a>. These tools allow you to drag and drop various components and parameters into a workflow, which the bot will execute.\u00a0<\/span><span>Once created, you\u2019ll export the MQL4 file and all supporting files, upload to MT4, and you\u2019ll have a fully functioning trading bot. <\/span><span>I\u2019ve personally created a range of simple trading bots using this method, and it\u2019s usually straightforward to do!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/fxdreema.com\">FxDreema<\/a> is the best tool on the market for this right now and has a free version for traders to build simple workflows. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Paying A Developer <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>There are literally hundreds of high-quality developers online that can easily create your bot for you. The price range for this will obviously vary hugely depending on your requirements.\u00a0<\/span><span>For example, a simple timed trading bot with easy risk management functionality may set you back \u00a3200. On the flip side, a more complex trading bot could cost \u00a35000 to develop fully.\u00a0<\/span><span>This is often quite a long process as there are many iterations and testing required from you as the developers are working on the bot.\u00a0<\/span><span>For simple bots, I\u2019d recommend using No-Code to get this done yourself. For more complex bots, perhaps consult a developer if you have the capital available.\u00a0<\/span><span>In terms of where you\u2019d find these developers, personally I\u2019ve used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancer.co.uk\">Freelancer<\/a> for any projects! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>In Summary &#8211; Can You Use A Trading Bot To Get Funded?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>So, in conclusion, you can very much use a trading bot to get a <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/lux-elite-traders-club\/\">funded account<\/a>, and it\u2019s actually very worth looking into!\u00a0<\/span><span>Many of our <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/lux-elite-traders-club\/\">Elite Traders<\/a> have used bots in their trading, either to fully or partially automate their trading strategies.\u00a0<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Give it a try yourself! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0<\/span><span>Looking for funding?
