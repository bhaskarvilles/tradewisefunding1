For example, all of our <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/lux-elite-traders-club\/\">Lux Elite Funded Traders<\/a> have passed a trading challenge to prove their ability before being trusted with real funds.\u00a0<\/span><span>With that being said, it\u2019s not always the right time to be purchasing a trading account challenge and there are various steps that you should be considering before pulling the trigger on the challenge.\u00a0<\/span><span>So, in this article, we are going to look at all the steps you should be taking to assess if you\u2019re ready to <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/#howwillyougrow\">become a funded trader<\/a>! Let\u2019s get into it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Purchasing A Prop Firm Trading Challenge &#8211; The Checklist <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>There\u2019s no denying the appeal of purchasing a prop firm challenge, even before you\u2019re ready to start trading on the account. By utilizing the funding available, traders can go from managing \u00a3200 to \u00a3100,000 overnight &#8211; something that wouldn\u2019t be possible in any other industry!\u00a0<\/span><span>However, the appeal of funded accounts can cause traders to be slightly too hasty in their approach and miss the key foundation steps that are needed to be successful.\u00a0<\/span><span>You may be thinking that this sounds counterintuitive for a prop firm to be saying this\u2026 However, Lux Trading is the only prop firm offering real trading capital. We only make profits if you do &#8211; so we want our traders to sign up when they\u2019re ready and be successful!\u00a0<\/span><span>So, let\u2019s take a look at the precursors you should be considering prior to adding that trading challenge to your cart\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Having A Trading Plan<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>If you are considering becoming a funded trader, you must have a trading plan in place. This has to be a rigid, rule-based trading plan. <\/span><span>If you\u2019re yet to create a trading plan, that\u2019s fine! You should be thinking about studying the markets and looking at various free materials online to create a base for you to work from and build upon. We discussed a <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2023\/02\/19\/forex-order-block-strategy-for-beginners\/\">potential trading strategy<\/a> to build from in this article.\u00a0<\/span><span>Once you\u2019ve then developed your strategy, you should be thinking about obtaining funding &#8211; not before.\u00a0<\/span><span>We\u2019ve covered <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2022\/10\/24\/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges\/\">how to build a trading plan for prop firms<\/a> in this article, but in essence, you need to make your trading plan as rule based as possible.\u00a0<\/span><span>With no trading plan in the markets, you turn the markets into a casino. You have no real edge in the markets and eventually, the house will win. Whereas with a tried and tested trading plan, you\u2019re essentially just filling the orders and executing within the market &#8211; with very little input from yourself.\u00a0<\/span><span>This makes a huge difference to win rates, profitability, and trading psychology as you\u2019re just following orders &#8211; there\u2019s no weight on your shoulders! <\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Back testing Your Trading Plan<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>Creating a trading plan is great, but it\u2019s entirely pointless if you don\u2019t know whether the trading plan will lead to profits or not. Not all trading strategies or trading plans are created equal and many will not have an edge within the markets, meaning after hundreds of trades, you\u2019ll be breakeven.\u00a0<\/span><span>There\u2019s no getting around the fact that back testing a system is time-consuming. To back test successfully, you need to simulate hundreds of \u2018valid\u2019 trades using your trading plan to assess profitability. Back testing<\/span><span> will also allow you to introduce changes to your trading system that will increase profitability and hopefully reduce your risk within the markets.\u00a0<\/span><span>There are various tools that can be used to back test, such as TradingView.\u00a0<\/span><span>If you haven\u2019t yet back tested a trading strategy, I\u2019d highly advise doing so before looking at pulling the trigger on your funded account. The reason for this is back testing can save you a huge amount of wasted time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re trading a plan that genuinely is not profitable, you could still have winning streaks. These winning streaks will naturally increase your confidence, and you\u2019ll most likely try to increase your risk per trade. When this ultimately stops winning, which it will, you\u2019ll be in trouble.\u00a0<\/span><span>I\u2019ve had many trading strategies previously that, I thought, were profitable, until I went onto back test them and realized that they didn\u2019t even break even over the long term! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re looking to do this step as quickly as possible, you could potentially get away with just 100 trades as a sample size. I would still recommend doing more, but with a sample size of 100 trades you should still have a good flavor for whether a system has a huge amount of drawdown or large losing streaks etc.\u00a0<\/span><span>It\u2019s crucial to bear in mind that if you have any bias whilst back testing, the results will be invalid. You need to be as cautious as possible and do not count a trade in the dataset if it doesn\u2019t meet 100% of the criteria set out in your trading plan. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Once you have a back tested trading strategy, I\u2019d recommend starting to consider becoming a funded trader.<\/span><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> <\/strong><strong>Having Your Trading Psychology In A Good Spot<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span>Psychology plays a gigantic part in trading and is arguably one of the biggest parts of the puzzle. You will be able to find many profitable trading strategies online that have been made into EA\u2019s or algorithmic trading systems.\u00a0<\/span><span>These trading strategies are all very simple, usually only combining one or two indicators and simple price rules to fulfill orders. Humans could, in theory, easily trade a system like this and be profitable.\u00a0<\/span><span>However, the robot is typically much more profitable, in this case, than the human. This comes down to a combination of human error and, more importantly, the psychological toll of trading. <\/span><span>As a trader, you need to be constantly able to monitor your fear and greed and make important decisions with very little time to decide. Decisions that will have consequences on your trading results.\u00a0<\/span><span>With that being said, once you can master your trading psychology, you will be able to just execute positions in the markets and feel nothing.\u00a0<\/span><span>At the point where you can face drawdown without being concerned and looking for a new trading system, you should be starting to look at <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/#howwillyougrow\">prop firm funding<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s worth noting that this level of confidence also comes from time within the markets. Back testing your trading strategy hundreds of times will give you that confidence in your ability as a trader and your strategies&#8217; ability within the markets. <\/span><span>Once you\u2019re at that point, funding should be something you consider. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>In Summary &#8211; When Should You Be Purchasing A Prop Firm Challenge? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>In conclusion, being a funded trader has a huge number of perks, but you don\u2019t need to jump into it without being ready! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Before purchasing a prop firm challenge, make sure:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You have a trading plan<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>You\u2019ve back tested the trading plan over 100 times<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>You have bulletproof trading psychology <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>If you have these 3 things in check, you\u2019re likely to walk through your funding account challenge and be funded in no time at all! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you are looking to become funded, work with <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\">Lux Trading Firm<\/a> now! <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Forex prop firms have taken the industry by storm over the last few months, and there has been a giant increase in the number of traders looking to obtain funded trading accounts.\u00a0To trade on a large sum of capital, you must first prove your trading ability by way of a funded account challenge.
