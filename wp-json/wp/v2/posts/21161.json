The reality is, getting a funded trading account is actually a very simple process and can be broken down into 6 steps.<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><span>It\u2019s worth mentioning that not everyone\u2019s prop firm funding journey is the same, this is purely the most straightforward way to become a funded trader! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this article, we\u2019re going to look at 6 steps to follow in order to obtain a funded trading account with a forex prop firm. Let\u2019s get into it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How To Get a Funded Trading Account in 6 Simple Steps<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>These days, you can\u2019t scroll online for more than 5 minutes without crossing paths with either a prop firm or a trader using one! <\/span><span>Luckily for us traders, this has opened the door to a huge amount of opportunity and capital that was previously reserved for professional traders and private funds.\u00a0<\/span><span>Now, even we retail traders with full-time jobs are able to get our hands on hundreds of thousands of dollars to trade with! <\/span><span>With that being said, it can be a confusing world to break into. We\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\">funded traders<\/a> all around the world, so we feel confident in stating the best practice and\/or best path to follow if your goal is to get funded. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Build A Forex Trading Strategy<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>Before even looking at prop firms or figuring out which prop firm you should be working with, you need an established forex trading strategy.\u00a0<\/span><span>This strategy needs clear and defined rules. The most successful trading strategies are those with the lowest degree of human interaction, as human error or subjectiveness can lead to many issues and dwindling returns.\u00a0<\/span><span>We\u2019ve published a full guide on <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2022\/10\/24\/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges\/\">how to create a trading strategy to pass prop firm<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2022\/10\/24\/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges\/\"> challenges<\/a>, that may be worth checking out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In short, you need to create a rule-based trading strategy that looks at risk management, entry criteria, stop loss parameters, take profit parameters, and trade management. All of these rules should be clearly defined so that even a newbie trader could follow the strategy and become profitable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0<\/span><span>If there is any nuance or subjectivity, your trading strategy is likely to fail.\u00a0<\/span><span>This step is by far the most important step, and it won\u2019t happen in days &#8211; this will take weeks or months of work to achieve. <\/span><span>We\u2019d strongly recommend reading this article, breaking down <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2022\/10\/10\/how-to-manage-drawdown-when-doing-a-prop-firm-challenge\/\">how to manage drawdown during a forex trading challenge<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Back Test &amp; Forward Test Your Forex Trading Strategy<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span>Once you have a trading strategy, you need to be confident enough in the strategy to be able to pull the trigger every single time, even if you\u2019re in a drawdown.\u00a0<\/span><span>Where does this confidence come from? <\/span><span>This comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/forexbrokerreport.com\/how-to-backtest-a-forex-trading-strategy-full-guide\/\">back testing<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Back testing is using past data to test an objective trading strategy hundreds of times, to test the effectiveness of the strategy. <\/span><span>This is a great way to see if a strategy is profitable or not profitable, without wasting capital or years of time trying to make it work.\u00a0<\/span><span>There are many tools in the market to back test a strategy within hours, rather than years. <\/span><span>Once you have over 200 trades, this gives you a good idea of the success and profitability. Ideally, you\u2019ll want maybe 500+ trades if you\u2019re taking this seriously and looking to create a strong trading strategy.\u00a0<\/span><span>If you\u2019re appearing to be profitable in a back test, you need to deploy a forward test.\u00a0<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This requires trading these setups in a live market, with real money. You don\u2019t need to use a large amount of capital, just enough to be taking this seriously.\u00a0<\/span><span>The point of this forward test is to train you to be taking these trades, without human error coming into effect. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> <\/strong><strong>Choose Your Prop Firm <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span>Once you have an established trading strategy, it\u2019s time to choose a prop firm to work with. There are many options to choose from, but it\u2019s important to understand which firm is right for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Some of the key aspects to consider: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Do they provide real trading capital?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Do they have a great reputation? <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Are there any withdrawal proofs?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Is capital scaling offered?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>What are the rules for the prop firm?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Who provides their trading accounts?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Can you find real details about the business?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>Once you have been through all of these criteria, you should have a good idea of which firm suits you.\u00a0 <\/span><span>We are biased, of course, but we\u2019d always recommend using a trading firm that provides traders with live trading capital.\u00a0<\/span><span>At <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\">Lux Trading Firm<\/a>, we give all of our traders <strong>real capital<\/strong>, rather than having you trade on demo accounts.

You\u2019ll also know how your trading strategy performs, from the back test that you have done prior to finding a prop firm. <\/span><span>If both of these align, great! If not, you\u2019ll have to make small amendments to your risk management strategy to ensure that you don\u2019t violate the firm&#8217;s rules.\u00a0<\/span><span>We\u2019d strongly recommend trying to stay \u2018alive\u2019, rather than focusing solely on profits. The best forex traders are just those that have managed to stay in the markets for the longest!<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> <\/strong><strong>Buy A Prop Firm Challenge<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span>Now we\u2019re all ready to get started and try your strategy within a prop firm challenge.
