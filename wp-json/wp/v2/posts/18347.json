The potential for huge amounts of trading capital with such a low barrier of entry does seem too good to be true.\u00a0<\/span><span>It\u2019s no secret that opportunists are making use of this growing industry and there are prop firms popping up out of thin air.\u00a0<\/span><span>With more funding options for traders, it\u2019s more important than ever to understand what\u2019s going on under the bonnet and get a more in-depth knowledge of how these firms are operating.\u00a0<\/span><span>So, let\u2019s find out more about the different models and <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2022\/06\/03\/how-do-prop-firms-make-money\/\">how prop firms make money<\/a>\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Truth About Forex Prop Firms<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>When we first started in the online prop firm industry, there were only a handful of firms, most of which are no longer in business.\u00a0<\/span><span>Since then, there are now around 50 new online forex prop firms and the number is rapidly growing &#8211; every week we hear of more companies popping up around the world.\u00a0<\/span><span>Although this is great for the industry and it\u2019s brilliant for retail traders to have opportunities to further their careers, the operating model has also rapidly changed.\u00a0<\/span><span>Historically, there has been a very simple model in which prop firms operate. Profitable traders are given a large sum of capital and the profits of their efforts and shared between them and the firm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The model that these new, carbon copy prop firms are using is more of a pyramid scheme style. Not only is this dangerous for traders, but it also won\u2019t be long until regulators start paying more attention to this type of activity.\u00a0<\/span><span>Let\u2019s take a deeper look at this type of prop firm below\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Gambling Prop Firm Model<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>The majority of the forex prop firms you\u2019ll be familiar with are purely operating on a gambling business model. They have no interest in working with profitable traders or even helping traders reach profitability.\u00a0<\/span><span>Traders are now offered instant funding with 100% profit splits. It\u2019s clear that if you\u2019re a profitable trader, you\u2019ll be paid out from other traders failing their trading challenges (which are designed to maximize failure rates).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>To date, Lux Trading Firm is the <strong>only firm<\/strong> to offer traders real, live money accounts and the training needed to make real, consistent returns in a responsible way.\u00a0<\/span><span>In fact, compared to other offerings within the market, we have slightly stricter risk management rules and a lower profit split. However, we have a much higher rate of funding than other firms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0<\/span><strong><span>Industry Average &#8211; 4% funded rate.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Lux Elite Club &#8211; 20% funded rate. <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re serious about trading for a living and learning proper risk management, being funded with real capital, and actually managing assets, rather than just gambling within a pyramid scheme, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/lux-elite-traders-club\/\">Elite Traders Club<\/a> for more information. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span>Churn Of Traders<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span>Prop firms operating this business model rely on clever marketing, get rich quick mentality, and a constant churn of newbie traders.\u00a0<\/span><span>It\u2019s clear that the majority of retail traders now know that most prop firms are giving them a virtual money account to trade on.\u00a0<\/span><span>It\u2019s even widely known that over 95% of traders fail prop firm challenges. With the profitable traders sitting on demo accounts, their withdrawals are being paid purely from the losses of other traders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Due to the clever marketing tactics, this still doesn\u2019t stop traders from paying the challenge fees over and over again. This dance is not going to stop until the regulators get involved.\u00a0<\/span><span>The promise of huge trading accounts and email marketing campaigns showing $100,000 withdrawals even manages to convince unprofitable or brand new traders that it\u2019s worth investing thousands into these new prop firms.\u00a0<\/span><span>As mentioned above, the industry average is that only 4% of traders will ever get funded, whereas Lux Trading Firm sees 20% of traders get funded as we\u2019re less focused on the churn of traders and more interested in working with profitable traders! <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span>Pressure From Regulators<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>The online forex prop firm space is one of the last forex sectors to be regulated but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t coming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0<\/span><span>All other areas of the online retail investing space have been regulated\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Brokers<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Education<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Scams<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Investment Funds<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>\u00a0<\/span><span>However, online prop firms are yet to receive a visit from the regulators. When the regulators come, and they always do, you\u2019ll see that the majority of the prop firms founded in the last year or two will immediately go under.\u00a0<\/span><span>The reason for this is the simple fact that these new firms are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/insights\/what-is-a-pyramid-scheme\/\">pyramid schemes<\/a>, disguised as prop firms and we know how the regulators feel about pyramid schemes\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span>Prop Firms Setting Traders Up To Fail<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>Historically, prop firms have always provided a platform and the toolset needed for traders to succeed. This is due to the fact real prop firms only make profits from profitable traders, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>However, this has now been flipped on its head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>These new-age prop firms offer trading conditions that require traders to gamble within the markets.\u00a0<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>10% profit targets with only very few trading days to complete<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Instant funding <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>High leverage <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Limited drawdown management <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>All of these factors inspire traders to push as hard as they can, with higher risk and lack of emotional intelligence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Prop firms purposely make it <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2022\/05\/30\/why-are-forex-prop-firm-challenges-so-hard-to-pass\/\">hard to pass a funding challenge<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The more traders that gamble, the more traders fail. With the business model these prop firms run, this equates to more money for them! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is the same situation with B-book brokers. Traders soon realized that their brokers were setting them up to fail and trading against them in the markets, so the majority of forex traders moved to the ECN brokers that had their best interest in mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>With the forex markets already being tough, why would you want your prop firm purposely making your job harder? <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span>100% Profit Split Prop Firms<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>It\u2019s important to look at the profit split being offered by the prop firm you\u2019re looking to trade with. If the profit split is somewhere around 50%, there\u2019s a chance that they\u2019re making money from profitable traders.\u00a0<\/span><span>However, many of these new firms are offering a 100% profit split to traders. This shows that they are making no profit at all from their profitable traders\u2026 So where is the profit coming from? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Well, it\u2019s coming from the traders failing their trading challenges! <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span>Instant Funding Prop Firms<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>Prop firms offering instant funding are very typically running the pyramid scheme style business model. It doesn\u2019t make sense from a business perspective to offer capital to a trader without knowing their trading ability or metrics.\u00a0<\/span><span>This shows that these prop firms will be offering you demo capital, rather than live trading funds. Now we have established the fact you\u2019re trading on demo funds &#8211; you need to look at where your payouts are actually coming from. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re on a demo account, the prop firm is making no money on your winning trades. Therefore, you are being paid out from other traders failing their trading challenges and losing money.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span>There is very little difference, if any, between this and a pyramid scheme and sadly it\u2019s only a matter of time before the regulators start paying attention. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>The Traditional Prop Firm Model<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span>Unlike every other forex prop firm in the industry, Lux Trading Firm operates the traditional funding model used by prop firms for decades.\u00a0<\/span><span>The model is extremely simple and we are very transparent with how we generate revenue. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Traders looking for large amounts of capital, come to us. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>We test their trading ability with realistic requirements &#8211; no gambling style challenges. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>We provide a 1-2-1 mentor, risk desk, analysis, an audit from <a href=\"https:\/\/home.kpmg\/xx\/en\/home.html\">KPMG<\/a>, tools, and a trading platform to help our traders succeed. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>20% Of the traders that enroll in the <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/lux-elite-traders-club\/\">Elite Trading Club<\/a> receive funding. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>We generate revenue from these profitable traders. We split the profits with these traders each and every month as they progress through their trading careers. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>We offer the profitable traders more capital at each milestone, meaning all parties increase their profits. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span>This is the simple model used by real prop firms all around the world. It\u2019s simple and it works. It\u2019s just less shiny than the instant funding scam! <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span>Retention Of Traders<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>It\u2019s important to think about what you\u2019re actually being offered by a prop firm. These new prop firms promise the world to traders, knowing that there is only a 4% chance they will ever achieve this.\u00a0<\/span><span>At Lux Trading we are much more realistic and traditional with our offering and expectations from traders.\u00a0<\/span><span>We aren\u2019t expecting a 10% return within 20 trading days because we know this isn\u2019t sustainable by the large majority of traders.\u00a0<\/span><span>We don\u2019t expect trades to be taken every day within the markets. Or 0.01 lot size positions to be taken to manipulate the minimum trading day requirements.\u00a0<\/span><span>Whereas only 4% of traders pass the typical challenge model, our Elite Club has a 20% pass rate which means we retain many more traders as career traders! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We give our traders everything needed to succeed and succeed in the right way &#8211; rather than getting lucky with a 10% trade and hoping to sustain that through a second phase. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span>50% Profit Split Prop Firms<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>Unlike these unethical prop firms, we offer a 50% profit split to our funded traders. You\u2019ll notice this is much lower than the 100% that some funds are offering.\u00a0<\/span><span>The reason for this is simply the fact we give our traders a REAL money account. This means we only get paid for your success. This is where all of our revenue comes from.\u00a0<\/span><span>This is historically how all of the prop firms in other markets have operated. We provide traders a huge wealth of education, risk management tools, and support, alongside vast sums of capital ranging up to $10,000,000.\u00a0<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In exchange for providing such a large volume of capital, we make a profit split from our traders. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span>No Instant Funding<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>With <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/lux-elite-traders-club\/\">Lux Elite Club<\/a>, we don\u2019t offer instant funding to our traders. The simple reason for this is the fact that we offer live trading capital to our traders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Although our challenge pass rate is 5x higher than the industry standard, we still have traders failing the trading challenge and we would not want to trust these traders with live capital, obviously.\u00a0<\/span><span>You will never see a traditional or legitimate prop firm offering instant funding to any traders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If a prop firm does promise you instant funding, you can be sure that you\u2019re trading on a demo account and you\u2019ll only be paid out if enough traders are failing the trading challenge. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>In Summary &#8211; The Secret Of Prop Firms<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>In Conclusion, you need to be aware of the prop firm you\u2019re working with. If the prop firm does not have your best interest at heart, there is a very low chance of you succeeding.\u00a0<\/span><span>You can actually equate the majority of prop firms to a pyramid scheme. They set you up to fail or pay you from the losses of other traders. They have great marketing and flashy graphics to keep the churn of traders coming in.\u00a0<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Lux Trading Firm operates the traditional prop firm model. Our revenue is generated from profitable traders. We do not make money on failing traders &#8211; hence why we put so much time, effort, and resources into getting all of our traders up to speed! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you trade with a real prop firm, there are so many <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2022\/06\/12\/why-you-should-be-trading-with-a-forex-prop-firm\/\">benefits of funded trading accounts<\/a>, <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re serious about trading and want to trade for a living, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/lux-elite-traders-club\/\">Elite Trading Club<\/a> or contact our team for more information. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Forex prop firms have divided the online retail trading community over the last few years.
