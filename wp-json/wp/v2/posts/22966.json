Let\u2019s get into it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How To Pass A Prop Firm Challenge<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>We\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\">funded traders<\/a> worldwide with trading capital of up to $10,000,000, so we know what it takes to pass a prop firm challenge.\u00a0<\/span><span>Unlike the large majority of firms in the industry, we are only making money on successful traders, as we provide live trading capital. This means it\u2019s in our best interest to share our tips, tricks, and knowledge to help get as many funded traders as possible!\u00a0<\/span><span>To that end, here are 8 tips you need to be aware of when you embark on a challenge\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Be Fully Aware Of the Terms Of Use<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>This is an essential first step when purchasing a funded trading account. If you are unaware of every rule, you\u2019re likely to violate your trading account fairly quickly.\u00a0<\/span><span>We\u2019ve seen traders blissfully unaware of drawdown limits and maximum loss limits, which obviously results in being unsuccessful in a challenge.\u00a0<\/span><span>Some firms are going to give you a \u2018do over\u2019 and let you retake a challenge for no extra fee, but this is very unlikely.\u00a0<\/span><span>Make sure that you\u2019re fully aware of all parameters for you to succeed. If any of the rules seem vague or purposefully cloudy, you should think twice about working with that company. They\u2019re most likely looking to trick traders to collect fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re interested in <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/rules-of-engagement\/\">our trading rules<\/a>, have a read! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. <\/strong><strong>Use Less Than 1% Risk Per Trade<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Time and time again, we see traders falling into the trap of rushing their challenges. If you think about a profit target of just 8%, it seems like a no-brainer to some traders to take a 1:4 position with a 2% risk.\u00a0<\/span><span>This will very often result in failure, as it\u2019s an unsustainable way to trade the foreign exchange markets.\u00a0<\/span><span>As a general rule of thumb, we\u2019d advise traders to be using less than 1% risk per trade. If possible, using somewhere around 0.25% per trade is a much safer bet.\u00a0<\/span><span>Sure, scaling up to 1% worth of risk in a position can be done, but it\u2019s certainly more of a gambling approach to obtaining funding.\u00a0<\/span><span>If you\u2019re unaware of your risk in a trade, there are many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfxbook.com\/forex-calculators\/position-size\">position size calculators<\/a> that you can use ahead of placing a position in the market. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. <\/strong><strong>Only Use A Back Tested Trading Strategy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>You\u2019d be surprised, or not, at the number of traders that \u2018test\u2019 a strategy on a <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\">funded trading account<\/a> challenge.\u00a0<\/span><span>Since you\u2019re paying for the challenge, you should be making sure that there is a good chance you\u2019ll succeed. To know this, you need to have a back-tested trading strategy in your portfolio.\u00a0<\/span><span>There is a huge amount of value and data to be obtained through back-testing a trading strategy, and it isn\u2019t an overly long process to undertake. <\/span><span>In essence, if you don\u2019t know the outcome of 300+ trades, with an objective setup, you have no idea if you\u2019re profitable or not. In fact, you\u2019re likely not!\u00a0<\/span><span>We\u2019d strongly advise that you come to the batting cages with a tried and tested strategy for hitting your home runs!\u00a0<\/span><span>For more information on <a href=\"https:\/\/forexbrokerreport.com\/how-to-backtest-a-forex-trading-strategy-full-guide\/\">how to backtest a trading strategy<\/a>, have a read here! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a04. <\/strong><strong>Don\u2019t Trade Correlated Currency Pairs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Correlated currency pairs can wreak havoc on trading results, and you really don\u2019t have the margin to be playing with when it\u2019s not your own trading capital.\u00a0<\/span><span>For instance, USDCAD, USDJPY, and USDCHF are all correlated due to the USD.\u00a0<\/span><span>If you take a Buy on one of these pairs, that may very well fit your trading plan and be well within your risk allocation.\u00a0<\/span><span>However, if you take a Buy on all 3 of these pairs, you may now be taking a fairly sizable loss in one day if something happens with the USD to push the price rapidly against your trades.\u00a0<\/span><span>This can, of course, work in the opposite way and create huge profits for traders when they catch the right side of these movements, but having less risk is always a positive! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Don\u2019t Trade During High Impact News Events<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>High-impact news events such as NFP can play a huge role in determining price movement in the forex market.\u00a0<\/span><span>The issue with high-impact news events is the fact that they can cause fairly large slippage in the markets. This slippage means that your stop-loss prices aren\u2019t guaranteed to get filled.\u00a0<\/span><span>Traders have been known to lose 3x their actual stop loss value due to the lack of liquidity during these rapid price movements caused by news events. <\/span><span>Of course, you cannot be aware of black swan events and their impact on the markets, but by using an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfxbook.com\/forex-economic-calendar\">economic calendar<\/a>, you can stay abreast of all upcoming news events in the day.\u00a0<\/span><span>If you are going to roll the dice during news events, ensure that you\u2019re only using a very small percentage of your account balance! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>6. <\/strong><strong>Scale Into Positions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Scaling into positions is a fairly advanced trading technique, but typically yields great results for traders.\u00a0<\/span><span>This typically involves entering a trading position with a small amount of risk, then moving your stop loss to breakeven. Once at breakeven, you then enter another position and add more risk to the table.\u00a0<\/span><span>This allows traders to, in theory, bank larger percentage gains from winning trades without ever needing to take on additional risk. A<\/span><span>lthough this sounds obvious, it\u2019s actually very challenging to pull off correctly and takes a lot of back-testing to do successfully! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Stick To Your Trading Plan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Sticking to your trading plan, like a robot, is key to success when looking to obtain a funded trading account.\u00a0<\/span><span>In theory, you should be able to give your trading plan to any trader in the world, and they would get the exact same results as you in the markets.\u00a0<\/span><span>Your trading plan should be thorough and objective. There should be no subjectivity included as this increases the risk of human error, emotions, and judgment calls being made.\u00a0<\/span><span>If you\u2019re looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/luxtradingfirm.com\/2022\/10\/24\/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges\/\">create a trading plan for prop firm accounts<\/a>, have a read of our guide! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a08. <\/strong><strong>Remove All Emotions Of Fear &amp; Greed<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Due to the constraints and rules of a funded trading account, emotions can run high. Compound these emotions with the fact that you\u2019re most likely trading a much larger sum of capital than ever before\u2026 This is a recipe for disaster.\u00a0<\/span><span>It can be very hard to do, but it\u2019s important to be completely emotionless in the markets. You should be following a rule-based trading plan to the letter of the law, meaning you could give that to any trader and the results would be the same.\u00a0<\/span><span>The point of this trading plan is to completely remove the emotional and \u2018human\u2019 aspect of trading.\u00a0<\/span><span>If this is something you struggle with, it\u2019ll be worth studying trading psychology before getting involved with a prop firm. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>In Summary &#8211; How To Pass A Prop Firm Challenge<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>These are our 8 tips for successfully passing a prop firm challenge!
