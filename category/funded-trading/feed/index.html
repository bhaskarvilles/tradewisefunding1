										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Funded trading accounts have become incredibly popular over the last few years, with thousands of retail traders becoming funded every month. </span><span>Alongside prop firms gaining popularity, automated forex trading and trading bots have also gained a huge amount of popularity over the last few years. Many traders either have a bot in their portfolio, or are at least dabbling with creating one. </span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we’re going to look at how <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2023/01/22/building-a-trading-bot-to-pass-a-prop-firm-challenge/">trading bots</a> can be used with a prop firm trading account, the benefits, the drawbacks and how to build your own bot! So, let’s get into it…</span></p>
<p><strong>Using An Automated Trading Bot To Pass A Prop Firm Challenge</strong></p>
<p><span>First, it’s important to realise that many prop firms, including <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com">Lux Trading</a>, allow traders to use bots in their trading challenges. </span><span>Typically, the only stipulation is the fact this needs to be your own trading bot, or you have access to the source code. Without this, the trader has no idea what the bot is doing or how it can manage risk &#8211; which will lead to many funded accounts blown. </span><span>Bots have been successfully used to obtain <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">funded accounts</a> and continue trading on those accounts after challenges have been completed. </span><span>In all honesty, bots can get some great results and a portfolio of well balanced bots can outperform most manual traders due to their lack of human error, emotion and ability to trade the strategy flawlessly for 24 hours a day. </span><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Benefits Of Using A Trading Bot On A Funded Trading Account</strong></h2>
<p><span>It may come as no surprise that there is a considerable range of benefits from using a trading bot on your <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">funded account</a>. Let’s take a look at some of them…</span></p>
<p><strong> 1. No Human Emotion</strong></p>
<p><span>The largest benefit, undoubtedly, is the fact the trading bot can just execute your trading parameters with no nuance, no emotion and no errors. </span><span>Humans typically make a huge number of errors when trading and let bias shape many of their trades &#8211; resulting in worse trading returns. </span><span>A bot has no emotions and will just execute the exact same trade over and over again until you turn it off. This is a huge value add to most traders. </span></p>
<p><strong> 2. </strong><strong>Back testing Functionality</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>With a trading bot, or portfolio of trading bots, you can easily run a <a href="https://forexbrokerreport.com/how-to-backtest-a-forex-trading-strategy-full-guide/">back test</a> over a period of years in minutes. </span><span>This is hugely valuable as you will know for certain whether your strategy is actually profitable or whether you were playing with luck when you had your winning streak. </span><span>Not only that, you’re going to have all of your numbers at hand in terms of drawdown and maximum losses over the last few years. This can help you frame your risk management strategy and give yourself a better chance of not losing your funded account by violating the risk parameters. </span></p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Ability To Never Miss A Trade</strong></p>
<p><span>Life and jobs get in the way for traders, and so does sleep! With a trading bot, it will run whenever you want it to run, meaning you’ll never miss a profitable trade. </span><span>With that being said, I’d recommend having a think about it only trading during London and New York sessions as the spreads and lack of liquidity may be a problem during Asian hours. </span></p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Ability To Create A Portfolio</strong></p>
<p><span>A human trader will struggle to put 5 strategies on the go at any one time. However, this is easy for a bot to handle. </span><span>The majority of profitable automated traders will have anywhere between 5 and 10 bots in their portfolio, resulting in less risk and more consistent returns in the market than if you were trading just the 1 strategy endlessly. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Drawbacks Of Using A Trading Bot On A Funded Trading Account</strong></p>
<p><span>Although there are certainly more positives than negatives, there are a few negatives when it comes to using trading bots that need to be considered.</span></p>
<p><strong>1. You Need To Purchase A VPS</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>To achieve consistency, you’re going to need to run your bot on some kind of dedicated server, typically a VPS. </span><span>Although this is tedious, the cost is only going to be around £20 per month for a VPS that can handle 1-5 trading bots, so it’s not too expensive! </span></p>
<p><strong> 2. </strong><strong>Bots Ignore Fundamentals &amp; News Releases</strong></p>
<p><span>Your bot will be completely oblivious to any fundamental impacts, news releases and anything else that could affect the price of currency. </span><span>This could be a blessing or a curse, depending on which way the market moves, of course. </span><span>Some traders monitor the news and turn their bots off during extreme volatility, so that may be an option for you to consider. </span></p>
<p><strong> 3. </strong><strong>Your Bot May Not Work</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>It’s possible that you or the developer has built the bot badly, and it’s taking invalid trades. This should be ironed out during the build process, but it’s worth bearing in mind. </span><span>If you’re taking invalid trades, it’s possible that your returns won’t mirror what you expected at all. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Building Your Forex Trading Bot</strong></h2>
<p><span>So, let’s assume you have a profitable <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2023/03/12/do-forex-trading-strategies-stop-working-over-time/">trading strategy</a> manually, and you’re looking to automate the strategy. </span><span>Until more recently, this would involve paying a developer thousands of dollars to create an EA for you that runs on your MT4 or MT5. Although an EA is still the easiest way to get this done, you now have more options at your fingertips, and you can actually <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2023/01/22/building-a-trading-bot-to-pass-a-prop-firm-challenge/">build a bot for free</a>!</span></p>
<p><strong>Precursor &#8211; Creating Rules</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>If you want to code a trading bot, you’re going to need to create rules for your strategy. If you need a candlestick to look a certain way, you’ll need to think about that in relation to the surrounding candles, etc. </span><span>It can take weeks to fine tune your rule set before looking at actually coding the bot, but once done, this will save a huge number of headaches when back testing! </span></p>
<p><strong>Using No-Code</strong></p>
<p><span>There are now some great ‘no-code’ tools available for <a href="https://forexbrokerreport.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-forex-trading-bots/">creating trading bots</a>. These tools allow you to drag and drop various components and parameters into a workflow, which the bot will execute. </span><span>Once created, you’ll export the MQL4 file and all supporting files, upload to MT4, and you’ll have a fully functioning trading bot. </span><span>I’ve personally created a range of simple trading bots using this method, and it’s usually straightforward to do!</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://fxdreema.com">FxDreema</a> is the best tool on the market for this right now and has a free version for traders to build simple workflows. </span></p>
<p><strong>Paying A Developer </strong></p>
<p><span>There are literally hundreds of high-quality developers online that can easily create your bot for you. The price range for this will obviously vary hugely depending on your requirements. </span><span>For example, a simple timed trading bot with easy risk management functionality may set you back £200. On the flip side, a more complex trading bot could cost £5000 to develop fully. </span><span>This is often quite a long process as there are many iterations and testing required from you as the developers are working on the bot. </span><span>For simple bots, I’d recommend using No-Code to get this done yourself. For more complex bots, perhaps consult a developer if you have the capital available. </span><span>In terms of where you’d find these developers, personally I’ve used <a href="https://www.freelancer.co.uk">Freelancer</a> for any projects! </span></p>
<p><strong>In Summary &#8211; Can You Use A Trading Bot To Get Funded?</strong></p>
<p><span>So, in conclusion, you can very much use a trading bot to get a <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">funded account</a>, and it’s actually very worth looking into! </span><span>Many of our <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">Elite Traders</a> have used bots in their trading, either to fully or partially automate their trading strategies. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Give it a try yourself! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>If you’re active in any of the online trading communities, you’ll be familiar with SMC or Smart Money Concepts. </span><span>This trading style has exploded over the last 6 months, with many of the more influential retail traders adopting this strategy and obtaining <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">funded trading accounts</a>. But, is this really the holy grail of trading? </span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we’re going to look at where SMC originated, its impact on getting prop firm funded and the reality of trading forex like an institution. So, let’s get into it&#8230; </span></p>
<p><strong>Smart Money Concepts &#8211; What Is This?</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp">Smart Money Concepts</a> or SMC for short, are a group of trading techniques used by retail traders to find pools of imbalance and liquidity within forex pairs. These order blocks are located and traded off by utilizing various entry methods. </span><span>Typically, the entry methods all involve a sweep of a high or low, a break of market structure, then a pullback to an area of liquidity or an order block. </span><span>In terms of higher time frame analysis, not much seems to be done, with most SMC traders focusing on the lower time frames. Most entries and trade markups seem to be undertaken on the M5 or M1 time frames, allowing for quick entries and intraday positions. </span></p>
<p><span>This technique has been used by Inner Circle Trader (ICT) for many years and became quite popular in the YouTube trading community. The elusive background of ICT and seemingly pinpoint accuracy in the markets made this quite appealing to many traders. </span><span>Many screenshots from TradingView and MT4 were shared on social media of traders obtaining 1:50+ RR trades, with pinpoint entries… Which got the world of retail traders thinking… </span></p>
<h2><strong>Differences Between SMC Trading &amp; Typical Price Action Trading Strategies </strong></h2>
<p><span>SMC trading is almost marketed as being better than standard price action or technical analysis, due to the fact you’re now trading on the side of banks. </span><span>However, is this true? </span><span>Well, not really! </span></p>
<p><span>There are a huge number of similarities between standard technical analysis and SMC concepts. In fact, with SMC, you’re still not looking at any real liquidity or order blocks. You’re perceiving what could, in fact, be order blocks within candlesticks and drawing these on your charts. </span><span>This is no different from conducting technical analysis, as you aren’t looking at footprint price data, only drawing patterns from candlesticks. </span><span>Does this mean SMC doesn’t work? No, not at all! We’re confident that SMC trading works just fine, much like technical analysis. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>There are three main reasons for this… </span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>SMC encourages high risk to reward ratios.<br />
</span></strong><strong> </strong>This is the main reason SMC trading works. You’re able to net high risk to reward trades. This will be crucial for staying profitable on a <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">funded trading account</a>.</li>
<li><strong>SMC traders focus on trading at times of high volume.<br />
</strong>By trading at specific session timings during the day, traders can capitalize on real market movement and volatility. This is useful in all trading strategies and something many traders overlook.</li>
<li><strong><span>SMC encourages traders to focus on lower time frames.<br />
</span></strong>By trading the lower time frames, you open yourself up to being able to trade a huge number of trades per month or quarter. When compared to a swing trader that takes 1 or 2 positions in the month, it is clear that the intraday trader will most likely net better returns, if they have a profitable edge in the markets!</li>
</ol>
<p><span>For these reasons, there is a slight difference between technical analysis and SCM within forex trading. However, the majority of the approach is the same &#8211; just dressed up to appear more intelligent! </span></p>
<p><strong>Will Trading SMC Help You Become A Profitable Trader?</strong></p>
<p><span>The question whether trading SMC will actually make you a profitable trader is really the wrong question to ask. </span><span>Sadly, as a retail trader looking to <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2023/03/12/do-forex-trading-strategies-stop-working-over-time/">trade subjective strategies</a>, there is not a holy grail strategy. In fact, most profitable strategies will only have a small edge over the markets. </span><span>To that end, SMC is not a holy grail strategy &#8211; it’s just another strategy. However, the risk management, risk reward ratios, trade timings and high trading volume are likely to get you from A to B faster, than swing trading for instance. </span><span>Currently, there is no data to prove that SMC traders are any more profitable than retail traders just focusing on their basic technical analysis. As the saying goes, ‘there are a thousand ways to skin a cat’. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re interested in trying the strategy in your own trading, there is a huge amount of free resources online, including on YouTube, where you can learn the strategies and <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2022/10/24/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges/">build your trading plan</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>As always, it’s recommended to back test this trading strategy first, then use demo capital before seeking prop firm funding or approaching this on live capital. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Reality Of Trading Like Institutional Traders </strong></p>
<p><span>The reality is that Smart Money Concept traders are not mirroring institutional order flow or behavior at all. In fact, you won’t find a professional trader within an institution, sitting on TradingView and analyzing charts. </span><span>Professional traders reading tape and utilizing order flow are using <a href="https://forexbrokerreport.com/how-to-use-footprint-charts-in-forex-trading/">footprint charts</a>. Footprint charts can be used to show delta and various other data types that can show the real flow of money in and out of the markets. </span><span>More retail traders are adopting footprint charts, which is great to see! Although, we must say, trading in this way is typically much harder and requires a much more profound understanding of financial systems than most traders have. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>It’s important to realize that you don’t need to trade like an institutional trader to make money in the markets! There are considerable differences between how professional traders make their returns and how retail traders get involved in the markets. The analysis is different, returns vary greatly, and you don’t need to be trying to mirror those folks in our to make a living from forex trading! </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re serious about wanting to trade with the banks, you’re better off learning to read footprint charts than you are learning to trade Smart Money Concepts! However, neither is better than the other! </span></p>
<p><strong>In Summary &#8211; Are SMC Traders Lying? </strong></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, SMC could be a great way for you to trade the markets, but so could more basic versions of technical analysis! </span><span>There are certainly some great lessons to be learned from SMC traders, including trading at optimal session times, using high risk to reward ratios and obtaining decent frequency within your trading. </span><span>With that being said, these learnings can be applied to any strategies, whether SMC or using trend lines &#8211; it doesn’t matter! </span></p>
<p><span>If you trade SMC, we’d love to hear your journey in the comments &#8211; did you have success before learning to trade SMC? </span></p>
<p><span>Are you looking to <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/select-platform-5k-trial/">become a prop firm funded trader</a>? Work with Lux Trading Firm now! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>If you’ve ever Googled anything about forex trading, I’m sure your browsers and social media are now full of posts from Forex mentors and gurus alike, looking to sell you their trading course and exclusive trading group. </span><span>In such an unregulated space, such as online education, it’s hard to gauge whether a forex trading mentor is legitimate and whether you actually need them to help you <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2022/09/04/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-to-trade-forex-profitably/">become consistently profitable</a> within the markets. </span><span>So, let’s discuss whether you really need a forex mentor… </span></p>
<p><strong>Is Mentorship Really Needed To Learn To Trade Forex?</strong></p>
<p><span>Simply put, you do not need a forex mentor or any kind of educational course to learn to trade forex. Trading, much to the dismay of many newbie traders, is a game that takes many years to master. </span><span>You will constantly see ‘traders’ selling courses or even just strategies that will promise to <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com">pass a funded account challenge</a> and make you ridiculous returns in the market. </span><span>You need to consider their motives, as mentors. </span></p>
<p><span>If it were true that </span>a trader could consistently generate these earth-shattering returns with a strategy that you could learn in 2 weeks, then every trading firm in the world would be snapping at their heels to take them on as a trader! <span>They’d have plenty of opportunities and <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">huge sums of trading capital</a> at their feet, meaning they wouldn’t need your £200 to teach you to trade! </span><span>In 2023, you’ve got to also consider the huge amount of free resources online. Whether it is on websites or YouTube, many traders publish their learnings online, meaning you can pick up strategies and build profitable trading systems without ever spending a penny! </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t me saying that there isn’t value in forex mentorship. In fact, I think there can be a huge amount of value in forex mentorship if done correctly. I’ve done both over the years &#8211; I had gone out on my own to become a <a href="https://forexbrokerreport.com/can-a-forex-trader-be-self-taught/">self-taught forex trader</a>, then paid for courses to try to learn from specific mentors that I thought to be great within the industry. </span></p>
<p><span>So, let’s discuss the benefits and drawbacks of paying to learn forex. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Are The Benefits Of Forex Mentorship?</strong></h2>
<p><span>If you manage to find a profitable forex trading mentor, there is a huge amount of potential benefits that can come with this! </span><span>It’s crucial to really take your time during this process and ensure that you conduct your full due diligence before putting faith in the trader, as you would with any other investment. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Let’s assume you do manage to find a legitimate forex mentor, with a great track record of profitability &#8211; this is what you’ll gain: </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>You will decrease the learning curve.</span></strong><span> Learning from someone that can teach you exactly what matters will mean that you can greatly decrease the learning curve in the markets. This usually takes years to navigate.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>You will get profitable faster.</span></strong><span> Due to this reduced learning curve, you will most likely start to net profits faster. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>You will recoup your cost of learning.</span></strong><span> Your cost to learn will become a small expense, compared to the potential profits you will be pulling out of the markets. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>You can go on to </span></strong><span><a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/"><strong>become prop firm funded</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Your new-found profitability allows you to become a funded trader and increase your capital under management! </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>These are the primary benefits of working with a legitimate mentor! It goes without saying that this can open the doors to a huge amount of success in your trading career if done correctly.</span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are The Drawbacks Of Forex Mentorship? </strong></p>
<p><span>There are a fair number of drawbacks when it comes to forex mentorship, but these primarily come back to choosing the wrong mentor to work with.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s important to understand that most mentors are just failed forex traders, looking to monetize the industry, seeing as they weren’t able to turn a profit trading. </span><span>Many legitimate and profitable traders wouldn’t even take your money, as it wouldn’t be worth their time! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>To that end, here are the main drawbacks associated with paying for forex mentorship: </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>It can be expensive.</span></strong><span> The cost is fairly high, with some mentors charging up to £5000 for courses and mentorship. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>It’s often repackaged versions of content already online.</span></strong><span> With so much free content online, these days, most trading courses or packages are just rehashed versions of content that you could get online for free. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>It can waste years of your learning. </span></strong><span>If you’re being ‘led down the garden path’, so to speak, learning the wrong things will cause you to waste years of your life where you could have been applying yourself to something else. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>You rarely have proof the strategies are profitable. </span></strong><span>The lack of proof means you will most likely not be profitable and will lose faith in what you’re doing, often claiming forex is impossible to trade or blaming yourself. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>A lack of success may cause you to give up on the industry.</span></strong><span> This is ultimately where 90% of traders end up going, out of the industry! </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For these reasons, please spend your time doing due diligence on the mentor you’re looking to work with! </span></p>

<p><span>Sadly for us traders, it’s not an easy feat to find a good forex mentor. In fact, you might manage to find one truly profitable trader offering mentorship, out of every 150 traders selling their online courses. </span><span>Something to bear in mind is ‘you wouldn’t learn a language from someone that cannot speak the language’. </span><span>This rings very true within the forex market. If a trader cannot prove a verified track record, then it’s not worth engaging with them. By proof, I don’t mean sending you a screenshot of an account on MT4 with £1,000,000 in it. </span><span>I mean seeing an auditable, third-party track record in their name, on a platform like <a href="https://www.myfxbook.com">MyFxBook</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>So, where can you find a mentor like this? </span></p>
<p><span>Sadly, there is no marketplace for truly profitable forex mentors, and it can take years to stumble across the right one. I’d strongly recommend being active within the forex trading community on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. </span><span>Keeping an ear to the ground will help you identify any potential mentors that may be able to improve your trading, rather than just taking your money. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Just to clarify, the hallmarks of a legitimate forex mentor are:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Making the bulk of their money from trading, not mentorship. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>No flashy lifestyle, no ‘laptop’ lifestyle. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>No quick win strategies or promises to <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2022/09/19/the-dangers-of-passing-a-prop-firm-challenge-services/">pass funded account challenges</a></span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Verified track record on MyFxBook (In their name)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If a mentor has all of these traits, there is a chance that they’re the mentor for you! </span></p>
<p><strong>In Summary &#8211; Do You Need A Forex Mentor?</strong></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, you do not need to pay a forex mentor to teach you how to trade forex if your goal is to be a profitable trader. </span><span>There is, obviously, value in working with the right mentor. If you can find a mentor with a verified track record on a third party platform, then I would fully recommend conducting further due diligence and seeing if they’re worth your time. </span><span>Finding the correct mentor may save you years of trial and error &#8211; but take your time in doing so, as the wrong mentor can set you back years! </span><span> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>It can take months of researching, refining and testing to find a profitable trading system in the markets. A profitable trading strategy can be the ticket to you obtaining a large amount of <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">funded capital</a> and becoming a full-time forex trader. But what if that strategy stops working? </span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Forex trading strategies can stop working over time. There is no rhyme or reason to this, but over the years, strategies can face draw downs and eventually stop working within the markets. There are ways to overcome this, however. </span></strong></p>
<p><span>In this article, we are going to look at why trading strategies stop working, how to identify if your strategy is no longer working and how you can hedge your risk of this happening. Let’s get into it…</span></p>
<p><strong>Do Forex Trading Strategies Stop Working Over Time?</strong></p>
<p><span>Forex trading strategies can be very complex, or very simple. Regardless of its complexity and moving parts, no system is immune to the possibility of it failing over time. Some of the most profitable trading systems in the world have stopped working after years or even decades after long profitable streaks. </span><span>The reason as to why strategies can fail is simple. The market is constantly evolving and changing. Institutions change how they trade, how money is moved, and, ultimately, the conditions you’re playing in will change. </span><span>As market conditions change, over the long term, this can eat away at your profitability until your system is no longer profitable. Of course, this can also work in the other direction, and you’ll actually see increased profits as market conditions change. </span><span>Ultimately, it’s impossible to avoid this fate. No matter how well you craft your trading system or how many indicators you add in, eventually, there is a small chance that the system will stop working. </span><span>So, how can we actually identify when this is happening and pivot our attention to other strategies? </span></p>
<p><strong>How To Identify If Your Forex Trading Strategy Has Stopped Working?</strong></p>
<p><span>Sadly, there is no way to identify that a trading strategy is no longer profitable, in real time. The reason for this is simple. If you take any trading strategy that is profitable over a 5-10 year period, there will be months, quarters or even years when the system does not make profits in the markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Does that mean that the system is not profitable? No, the trading strategy will still be profitable over the long term. This is where the argument gets tricky. </span></p>
<p><span>As a trader, you want to limit your exposure to trading strategies that are having a rough quarter or year and move focus into those strategies that are proving more fruitful. However, without the benefit of hindsight, this is more or less impossible. </span><span>This, of course, needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. If your trading strategy was never profitable in the first place, it’s going to be very hard to gauge whether it is now failing. </span><span>To identify whether the trading strategy is profitable, you need to back test the system over a long period of time. By a long period of time, I mean maybe 2–5 years of data. During this back testing, you’ll have a great idea of the maximum loss streaks and draw-downs you’re likely to see when trading the strategy. Y</span><span>ou know that over the last 4 years, your exact trading strategy had a maximum drawdown of 7%, and a maximum losing streak of 12 trades. You now know that if you’re down more than 7%, you need to start considering the fact that the system is no longer profitable. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>This, of course, could be a rough patch of drawdown and nothing to worry about. Or, this could be the effect of changing market conditions and the trading strategy is no longer profitable. </span><span>Ultimately, you need a lot of back test data at your fingertips to be able to make this decision, and you should not stop trading your strategy in the live markets until you have the data at your disposal. </span></p>
<p><strong>Avoiding Your Forex Trading Strategy Failing &#8211; What Can You Do?</strong></p>
<p><span>So, we have already established that you cannot stop a strategy from failing. However, you can hedge your risk to reduce periods of loss and drawdown. </span><span>This will be incredibly important if you’re seeking a funded trading account, as you’ll want to limit drawdown and losing periods as much as possible. </span><span>Forex prop firms like <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com">Lux Trading Firm</a> will typically have a maximum drawdown and daily loss limit, to ensure you’re trading capital responsibly and not making erratic trading decisions. This means that for trading strategies that stop working, you’re likely to blow through those limits and lose your <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">trading capital</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>However, you can mitigate this risk. </span></p>
<p><span>This is where diversification comes into play. There is no need to stick with just one trading strategy within the markets, there are thousands of potentially profitable trading strategies for you to use. </span><span>Many traders that stand the test of time in the markets have 4–5 strategies in their portfolio, all being traded in the markets at any one time, in different accounts, or even with different prop firms.</span></p>
<p><span>As one trading strategy becomes unprofitable and stops working over time, these losses are hedged by the other profitable strategies. After a few months have passed, or at the point you realize that the trading system is breakeven or losing money, you can pull this out of the portfolio. </span><span> </span><span>At this point, you would want to tweak the trading strategy and see if you can manipulate the edge and logic to get this back to a profitable state. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>It’s important that these trading strategies are not correlated. For example, do not use multiple trading systems using EMA crossovers with very similar logic. The chances are that these systems will both be losing at the same time and double your losses, creating an issue for your maximum drawdown limits. </span><span>When running your back test data, use the same currency pairs across your multiple trading strategies and compare the balance/returns graphs. The peaks and troughs of net balance should be in no way correlated. </span><span>If the peaks and troughs are forming in the same areas of the chart, you know that these systems are too closely correlated, and you wouldn’t want to run these systems simultaneously as losses will mount up. </span></p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion &#8211; Do Forex Strategies Stop Working Over Time? </strong></p>
<p><span>In summary, forex trading strategies will stop working over time as market conditions change. However, there are always new strategies appearing and edges being developed in the markets constantly. </span><span>To stay safe for the long term, limit your risk per trade. You need to be looking at a trading strategy over a very long period of time, instead of just a few days/weeks. </span><span>Also, having multiple uncorrelated trading strategies in your portfolio is a great way to increase profits and reduce risk. Aim to create 3-5 profitable trading strategies to be traded in the markets at any one time &#8211; this is the best chance you have as a trader to ensure long-term profitability!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Forex trading has always been known as an industry you can start with very little capital up front. The lower barriers of entry make it a very attractive prospect for retail traders looking to get into such a liquid market. But is this true? </span></p>
<p><span>You need at least £1000 to start forex trading in 2023, if you’re being conservative. In an ideal world, you’d have £2000 &#8211; £3000 saved and ready to use within the markets if required. </span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we will look at all the different factors and costs you need to consider when starting your journey in the forex markets. So, let’s get into it! </span></p>
<p><strong>How Much Money Do You Need To Start Forex Trading In 2023?</strong></p>
<p><span>Forex trading is not as cheap to start as people may think. Due to rampant social media marketing from gurus and influencers, it’s in the back of everyone&#8217;s heads that you can start forex trading with £10 and an iPhone. </span><span>Although this statement is technically not completely untrue, you will not be making any kinds of profits and certainly not living the ‘forex lifestyle’ as marketed. In fact, you’re likely to blow through your £10 in one trade, and then you’ll be back to square one. </span><span>Forex trading, like any other method of generating income or returns, is a business. Your admittance into the forex arena should be planned, methodical and calculated. This includes understanding how much money you’ll need to get your seat at the table. </span><span>Below, we are going to break down all of your potential costs, so you can clearly understand how much money you need to start forex trading. It’s worth bearing in mind that we are looking to do this with the least money needed as possible. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Factors To Consider When Budgeting To Start Trading Forex </strong></h2>
<p><span>These are the main costs or factors you have to consider when starting your forex trading journey…</span></p>
<p><strong>Brokers Minimum Deposits</strong></p>
<p><span>Whilst looking at how much money you require to start forex trading, it’s important to consider the minimum deposit brokers will accept. This is going to range from broker to broker, depending on where they’re based, their regulations and leverage requirements. </span><span>As a general rule, you aren’t going to find a regulated broker willing to offer you a live trading account without a minimum deposit size of £200. </span><span>You’ll be able to find many offshore/unregulated brokers offering £10 deposits with gigantic levels of leverage, but these brokers will just be taking your money, frankly. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s also worth remembering that you should be trading on demo account funds, way before you even think about opening a real-money funded account. Demo accounts are typically free to open and allow you to simulate real market conditions, with fake money. </span><span>The reason for the demo account first is simple. Without a solid understanding of lot sizes and risk management, you’re going to lose whatever you deposit into your trading account. If that’s £100 first, you’ll likely lose that £100. </span><span>However, once you have furthered your learning, we can hope that you’ll apply strict risk management and not lose your trading funds so quickly. </span><span>To that end, allow a minimum of £200 &#8211; £500 for minimum broker deposits. </span></p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p><span>Some traders like to learn from the markets and some like to learn from courses. Of course, unless you’re looking to seek knowledge from free online channels, you’ll most likely need to pay for trading education. </span><span>As a general port of call, I’d recommend making use of all the free online resources that you can get your hands on first. These are going to teach you the basics of trading and give you an excellent idea of what you’re getting yourself into. You may even realize that trading isn’t for you, and you could have wasted your investment if you’d purchased a course. </span></p>
<p><span>Once you’re through all the basics, and you’re starting to get really invested in the idea of trading, it might be the right time to buy a course. There are plenty of courses and education resources out there, covering all kinds of different trading topics. </span><span>It’s worth being very cautious, however, as many of the courses you see are just rehashed versions of free online content. In fact, most ‘mentors’ are just unprofitable traders, looking to make some money from their failed venture. Obviously, it’s not going to be worth learning from them. </span><span>So, how do you know whom to learn from? You need to see a verified track record from MyFxBook or a similar third-party website. If you have this, it may be worth looking into. I</span><span>n terms of price point for trading education, it can vary greatly. I’d recommend that it’s not worth ever spending more than £500 on a trading course. In fact, even that is a bit steep. </span><span>I would want to make it perfectly clear, though, that there is no secret strategy within the markets, no one has something to sell that you couldn’t find online, for free. Certainly, do not dedicate a large budget to paying for trading education. </span></p>
<p><strong>Trading Platform Costs</strong></p>
<p><span>Typically, you’ll be able to get a trading platform for free through a brokerage account. For example, the majority of the largest brokers are providing traders with MetaTrader 5 and MetaTrader 4 to use as their trading platforms. </span><span>Some brokers are even offering in-house designed platforms, but these vary significantly in quality. </span><span>Many retail traders like to use TradingView as their charting software of choice, then use MetaTrader to execute the positions. The reason for this is simply MetaTrader was not designed with all the user experience perks that TradingView was. </span><span>Therefore, if you’re going to be back testing and staring at charts for hours each day, you may as well invest in the highest functionality. </span></p>
<p><span>To that end, I’d allow £20 per month in costs associated with trading platforms. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Cost Of Obtaining Funded Trading Accounts</strong></p>
<p><span>The next cost you need to consider is the cost of obtaining trading capital. Although £1000 is enough to get you started in this industry, it’s not going to be even close to enough money to earn any kind of decent profits. </span><span>Let’s break down the numbers… A very profitable and consistent trader may net an average return of 4% per month. This is an excellent figure. </span><span>On an account size of £1000, this will be £40 profit per month, pre-tax. On a £10,000 balance it’ll be £400 per month. </span><span>You can clearly see that if you’re going to trade for the long term, you need to have at least £100,000 in trading capital behind you. Most people don’t have this level of capital to invest, of course, which is where prop firm funding comes in. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com">Lux Trading Firm</a> funds our traders with up to £10,000,000 in real funds, in exchange for a profit split. When our traders profit, we profit. If you want additional information around our <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">funded accounts</a>, have a read! </span></p>
<p><span>In short, to take an evaluation (when successful, you’ll be funded £100,000), you will be paying £449. This will be refunded to you, upon being successful and receiving your funding. </span></p>
<p><span>You should not seek to obtain a funded account until you’re already a profitable forex trader, but once you are, this is a necessary cost that you need to consider. A lack of trading capital and profits is one of the main reasons why traders ‘hang up their tools’ in the industry, when they just needed to continue executing their system on a larger amount of trading capital. </span></p>
<p><strong>Hardware Costs</strong></p>
<p><span>If you’ve ever seen a movie that has trading in, you’ll have it in your head that traders all need 4 monitors and a top of the range computer. Frankly, this isn’t true and is overkill, especially for retail forex traders. </span><span>I’d highly recommend avoiding purchasing any additional computers, screens, or hardware at all, unless you simply cannot access the markets with your current setup. </span><span>If you are struggling to download trading software or have latency issues, you could experiment with logging into a VPN before you look at buying a whole new setup. VPN’s, specific for trading, will set you back maybe £20 per month, whereas a new trading setup will cost thousands, if you’re looking for the top of the range. </span></p>
<h2><strong>In Summary &#8211; How Much Money Do You Need To Start Trading Forex?</strong></h2>
<p><span>In conclusion, you’ll need at least £1.000 to start forex trading in 2023. If you’re looking to have a bit of a cushion behind you, I’d recommend at least £2.000 &#8211; £3.000 in capital to be spent on trading platform costs, education, broker minimum deposits and prop firm funding.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Forex prop firms have taken the industry by storm over the last few months, and there has been a giant increase in the number of traders looking to obtain funded trading accounts. </span><span>To trade on a large sum of capital, you must first prove your trading ability by way of a funded account challenge. For example, all of our <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">Lux Elite Funded Traders</a> have passed a trading challenge to prove their ability before being trusted with real funds. </span><span>With that being said, it’s not always the right time to be purchasing a trading account challenge and there are various steps that you should be considering before pulling the trigger on the challenge. </span><span>So, in this article, we are going to look at all the steps you should be taking to assess if you’re ready to <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">become a funded trader</a>! Let’s get into it…</span></p>
<h2><strong>Purchasing A Prop Firm Trading Challenge &#8211; The Checklist </strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong><span>There’s no denying the appeal of purchasing a prop firm challenge, even before you’re ready to start trading on the account. By utilizing the funding available, traders can go from managing £200 to £100,000 overnight &#8211; something that wouldn’t be possible in any other industry! </span><span>However, the appeal of funded accounts can cause traders to be slightly too hasty in their approach and miss the key foundation steps that are needed to be successful. </span><span>You may be thinking that this sounds counterintuitive for a prop firm to be saying this… However, Lux Trading is the only prop firm offering real trading capital. We only make profits if you do &#8211; so we want our traders to sign up when they’re ready and be successful! </span><span>So, let’s take a look at the precursors you should be considering prior to adding that trading challenge to your cart…</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Having A Trading Plan</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong><span>If you are considering becoming a funded trader, you must have a trading plan in place. This has to be a rigid, rule-based trading plan. </span><span>If you’re yet to create a trading plan, that’s fine! You should be thinking about studying the markets and looking at various free materials online to create a base for you to work from and build upon. We discussed a <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2023/02/19/forex-order-block-strategy-for-beginners/">potential trading strategy</a> to build from in this article. </span><span>Once you’ve then developed your strategy, you should be thinking about obtaining funding &#8211; not before. </span><span>We’ve covered <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2022/10/24/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges/">how to build a trading plan for prop firms</a> in this article, but in essence, you need to make your trading plan as rule based as possible. </span><span>With no trading plan in the markets, you turn the markets into a casino. You have no real edge in the markets and eventually, the house will win. Whereas with a tried and tested trading plan, you’re essentially just filling the orders and executing within the market &#8211; with very little input from yourself. </span><span>This makes a huge difference to win rates, profitability, and trading psychology as you’re just following orders &#8211; there’s no weight on your shoulders! </span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Back testing Your Trading Plan</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong><span>Creating a trading plan is great, but it’s entirely pointless if you don’t know whether the trading plan will lead to profits or not. Not all trading strategies or trading plans are created equal and many will not have an edge within the markets, meaning after hundreds of trades, you’ll be breakeven. </span><span>There’s no getting around the fact that back testing a system is time-consuming. To back test successfully, you need to simulate hundreds of ‘valid’ trades using your trading plan to assess profitability. Back testing</span><span> will also allow you to introduce changes to your trading system that will increase profitability and hopefully reduce your risk within the markets. </span><span>There are various tools that can be used to back test, such as TradingView. </span><span>If you haven’t yet back tested a trading strategy, I’d highly advise doing so before looking at pulling the trigger on your funded account. The reason for this is back testing can save you a huge amount of wasted time. </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re trading a plan that genuinely is not profitable, you could still have winning streaks. These winning streaks will naturally increase your confidence, and you’ll most likely try to increase your risk per trade. When this ultimately stops winning, which it will, you’ll be in trouble. </span><span>I’ve had many trading strategies previously that, I thought, were profitable, until I went onto back test them and realized that they didn’t even break even over the long term! </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re looking to do this step as quickly as possible, you could potentially get away with just 100 trades as a sample size. I would still recommend doing more, but with a sample size of 100 trades you should still have a good flavor for whether a system has a huge amount of drawdown or large losing streaks etc. </span><span>It’s crucial to bear in mind that if you have any bias whilst back testing, the results will be invalid. You need to be as cautious as possible and do not count a trade in the dataset if it doesn’t meet 100% of the criteria set out in your trading plan. </span></p>
<p><span>Once you have a back tested trading strategy, I’d recommend starting to consider becoming a funded trader.</span><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> </strong><strong>Having Your Trading Psychology In A Good Spot</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Psychology plays a gigantic part in trading and is arguably one of the biggest parts of the puzzle. You will be able to find many profitable trading strategies online that have been made into EA’s or algorithmic trading systems. </span><span>These trading strategies are all very simple, usually only combining one or two indicators and simple price rules to fulfill orders. Humans could, in theory, easily trade a system like this and be profitable. </span><span>However, the robot is typically much more profitable, in this case, than the human. This comes down to a combination of human error and, more importantly, the psychological toll of trading. </span><span>As a trader, you need to be constantly able to monitor your fear and greed and make important decisions with very little time to decide. Decisions that will have consequences on your trading results. </span><span>With that being said, once you can master your trading psychology, you will be able to just execute positions in the markets and feel nothing. </span><span>At the point where you can face drawdown without being concerned and looking for a new trading system, you should be starting to look at <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">prop firm funding</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s worth noting that this level of confidence also comes from time within the markets. Back testing your trading strategy hundreds of times will give you that confidence in your ability as a trader and your strategies&#8217; ability within the markets. </span><span>Once you’re at that point, funding should be something you consider. </span></p>
<p><strong>In Summary &#8211; When Should You Be Purchasing A Prop Firm Challenge? </strong></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, being a funded trader has a huge number of perks, but you don’t need to jump into it without being ready! </span></p>
<p><span>Before purchasing a prop firm challenge, make sure:</span></p>
<p>You have a trading plan</p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>You’ve back tested the trading plan over 100 times</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>You have bulletproof trading psychology </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you have these 3 things in check, you’re likely to walk through your funding account challenge and be funded in no time at all! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>To be successful in forex trading requires a trading strategy &#8211; something you can execute in the markets time and time again. Repeat this style of trade for many months or years, and you will see positive returns in the market due to having an edge. </span><span>As simple as that sounds, <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2022/10/24/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges/">creating a forex trading strategy</a> is not easy or simple. This also rings true when looking at forex order block trading. </span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we are going to create an order block trading strategy for you to back test, tweak and test, with the aim of providing a solid foundation to build a profitable strategy upon and <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">obtain prop firm funding</a>. </span><span>Let’s get into it… </span></p>
<h2><strong>Creating A Forex Order Block Trading Strategy </strong></h2>
<p><span>When creating a forex trading strategy, the most important aspect to consider is making it as objective as possible. It’s easy to bring hindsight into the equation when back testing and looking at the markets. However, this won’t help you in a real market trading situation. </span><span>Therefore, it’s incredibly important to eliminate as much human decision-making as possible and make the strategy very easy to follow. By doing this, human error will be reduced or completely avoided, and you’ll have an objective trading system that could be done by a robot. </span><span>So, let’s build a foundation for the trading plan to be built upon… </span></p>
<p><strong>Creating A Trading Strategy</strong></p>
<p><span>Firstly, a trading plan or strategy should be documented. There’s very little point in even aiming to create a trading plan if you’re going to leave it sitting in your head. Humans, sadly, are very open to influence, bias and frankly forgetting the plan. </span><span>By storing this strategy in a document, even a physical printed document, you have a standard operating procedure to follow. This will enable better decision-making, faster decision-making, and back testable results with no elements of luck or gambling involved. </span><span>Not only that, by removing all the human decision-making, there is a lot less stress placed on the trader. You don’t need to be thinking or trying to understand the market completely (which is impossible), you just need to read the plan, match that to the current market situation and execute the trade, as told. </span></p>
<p><strong>Identifying Forex Order Blocks</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2023/02/12/what-are-order-blocks-in-forex-and-how-can-you-profit-from-them/">Identifying forex order blocks</a> can be challenging at first, as we (retail traders) do not have access to real order flow numbers. </span><span>This means that traders have to use candlestick formations and market movement to assume the formation of order blocks. However, once you have an eye for doing so, you will be able to identify order blocks with a high degree of accuracy. </span><span>Order blocks, in their simplest form, are just areas of price where orders have been building up. This will typically look like &#8220;Rally, base (consolidation), rally&#8221; in the price movement, or vice versa. </span><span>You will never truly know if there is a large number of orders at that price point, until the price reacts (or doesn’t) upon return. </span><span>I would highly recommend familiarising yourself with a huge amount of order block content on YouTube, until the point where you can start finding these on your own. Once done, you want to perfect that skill by spending many hours on the charts. </span></p>
<p><span>Over time, you’re going to notice that certain styles of order blocks have stronger win rates and price movements than others &#8211; this will be amended in your trading plan.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blocks1.png?resize=624%2C280&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="280" class="alignnone wp-image-27402 size-full" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blocks1.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blocks1.png?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blocks1.png?resize=600%2C269&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Multi Time Frame Analysis For Entry Points</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>We’ve established that the first stage in the trading plan is to find an order block, without that, there is not a need to be looking at any price movements within the markets. </span><span>If we have an established order block, we can move onto the next step of the trading plan &#8211; multi time frame analysis. </span><span>We don’t want to just enter a trade on an order block with no further analysis because we don’t know for sure that there are any orders there. We would just be gambling on a hunch. </span><span>Instead, wait for the price to reject the order block &#8211; then start looking for entries. </span></p>
<p><span>In this situation, we can clearly see that price has rejected the order block that we had identified on the 1H timeframe &#8211; great!</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blocks2.png?resize=624%2C280&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="280" class="alignnone wp-image-27401 size-full" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blocks2.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blocks2.png?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blocks2.png?resize=600%2C269&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> </span></p>
<p><span>However, there was no real price action movement on the 1H timeframe, meaning we need to use other time frames to help build our entries. Firstly, looking on the 4H timeframe, price was in a long-standing bearish trend. </span><span>This bearish trend on the higher time frame would help build a picture for the trade. I would recommend adding a ‘higher time frame confluence’ into your trading plan. </span><span>Moving down onto the 15-Minute timeframe for an entry point, we can identify a support level (previous resistance), holding nicely. The break of this support would indicate to us that price is rejecting the order block in a very strong fashion, and we need to be looking at taking a trade to the downside. </span></p>
<p><span>This should be added to your trading plan. Your trading plan should now be something like this &#8211; </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify valid order block.</li>
<li><span> </span><span>Identify higher time frame confluence. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Identify lower time frame entry point using price action analysis. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you can also find an economic confluence too, that would be great here! </span></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Risk Management Criteria </strong></p>
<p><span>Now it’s time to enter the trade, and you must be considering all aspects of risk management. Many forex traders are looking to get <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">prop firm funding</a>, so it’ll be important to understand the <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/rules-of-engagement-3/">rules of engagement</a> with your chosen prop firm. </span><span>In these criteria, you need to clearly define your fixed stop loss value in percentages, your maximum open exposure and maximum daily trades. </span><span>For those traders serious about becoming funded traders, I would recommend using less than 1% per trade, having only 2 trades open at any one time and having no limit on daily trades opened, provided the other 2 criteria are fulfilled. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>You should also have rules implemented for situations where high-impact news is going to affect the currency pairs you’re trading that day. For example, staying out of all positions on NFP day could be a good idea. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Regardless of what you decide to implement in terms of risk management, your main goal should always be to stay alive in the market or in this case, stay funded. Always play on the side of caution, and this should help to keep you much safer in the markets. </span></p>
<p><strong>Trade Management </strong></p>
<p><span>Once your risk management criteria have been identified and solidified in your trading plan, you need to think about all the management criteria of the trade. </span><span>Ideally, you won’t be wanting to net a 1:1 risk to reward ratio in a trade. That would mean that whenever you risked £10, you profited £10 or lost the £10. The issue with this is the fact that your edge in the forex market will always be fairly small, so you need a good risk to reward ratio to be able to make consistent profits. </span><span>With that in mind, a fairly standard industry practice is to take at least a 1:2 risk to reward out of the market. However, some traders like to ignore the target risk to reward and just find an area of price they think the market will move. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>So, you need to consider either… </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span>Taking a fixed take profit based on risk to reward</li>
<li>Taking profit based upon market movement<span> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p><span>Both of these are completely valid ways to trade, depending on what your back testing shows you to be more profitable over the long term. </span><span>Once you’ve decided that, you need to also consider when you should be moving to breakeven or if you’re going to move your stop loss to breakeven at all during a trade. </span></p>
<p><strong>An Example Trading Plan</strong></p>
<p><span>So, now if we compile all of our steps so far, we should have a skeleton trading plan to start our back testing. It’ll look something like this…</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span>Identify order block</li>
<li><span> </span><span>Identify higher time frame confluence </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Identify lower time frame entry point using price action</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Confirm fundamental analysis if possible </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Enter the trade with 0.25% risk, stop loss on the last high/low.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Set a fixed take profit at 0.5% profit on account balance. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Move the stop loss to breakeven once profit reaches 1:1 risk to reward.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span>Extra condition &#8211; Do not trade during high-impact US news events.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Extra condition &#8211; Do not trade on Fridays.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Extra condition &#8211; Do not trade outside of London trading hours. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next Steps &#8211; Back testing A Forex Trading Strategy </strong></p>
<p><span>This is, of course, a very high-level initial trading strategy and isn’t ready for the live markets. Why? Because it has not been tested. </span><span>Although a lot of the logic appears to be sound, that will not be enough when real trading capital is on the line. At this point, you need to start back testing the trading strategy and logging all trades in a spreadsheet. Look at all relevant data points, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span>Timeframes</li>
<li><span> </span><span>Win/Loss</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Time taken </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>If you moved SL to breakeven at 1:1(for example) risk to reward, what was the outcome </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Screenshot</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Entry criteria </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Duration of trade </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>News during the trade </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All of these data points will be crucial in helping fine tune the strategy. This can be done hundreds of times and various tweaks should be made to the trading plan until you are as profitable as possible, with the least amount of risk. </span><span>In an ideal world, your trading plan should be so defined by this point that you could actually pay a freelance developer to code this into an EA. If that is possible, you’ll be able to back test thousands of trades in minutes and make a huge number of tweaks until you find that sweet spot. </span></p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion &#8211; How To Create A Forex Order Block Trading Strategy </strong></p>
<p><span>In summary, this is how you create a forex trading strategy for order blocks. This isn’t a finished strategy that is ready for live market trading, but it’s ready to be back tested and will give you a solid foundation to build on. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Over the last few years, there have been a huge amount of new strategies and developments in the world of retail forex trading. Until more recent years, retail forex traders used to solely rely on technical analysis (E.G support and resistance) to spot trading opportunities. </span><span>Recently, more trading strategies revolving around institutional trading opportunities have come into the market, with many retail traders hoping to ride the coattails of those moving the markets. </span></p>
<p><span>This is how order blocks are formed…</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span>&#8220;An order block is an area of price with large volumes of trading positions taken by institutions and banks. This can cause large movements in the prices of currency pairs and also provides potential trading opportunities for retail forex traders.&#8221;</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span>In this article, we will take a look at order blocks in the forex market, why they’re useful and how you can profit from them as a trader. Let’s get into it…</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Are Order Blocks In The Forex Market? </strong></h2>
<p><span>Order blocks are a fairly simple concept that is often overcomplicated in the hopes of selling traders a course to explain it. </span></p>
<p><span>In simple terms, institutions (such as banks and hedge funds) cannot take all of their positions in one go. Again, in simple terms, the orders they are looking to place are so large that the order itself moves the price of the currency away from that order price, before being able to fill the whole order. Of course, this is massively oversimplified, but the point stands. </span></p>
<p><span>For this reason, the institutions tend to enter a quantity of buy or sell orders in a ‘block’, instead of in one position. These blocks provide an area in which price typically moves away linearly, proving great trading opportunities. </span><span>In fact, many of our <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">funded traders</a> use order blocks to help create a directional bias on the higher time frame charts, before looking for entry opportunities on the lower time frame charts. </span></p>
<h2><strong>How Do You Find Order Blocks?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Finding an order block isn’t always simple, as the markets do not always give us a clue. In an ideal world, an order block will be an area of consolidation, where positions were building up, followed by a large bullish or bearish run. </span><span>This chart is showing USDJPY on the daily timeframe. By breaking down the various stages of the market, you can see a clear consolidation (highlighted), where an order block was forming.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-USDJPY.png?resize=624%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="281" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27067" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-USDJPY.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-USDJPY.png?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-USDJPY.png?resize=600%2C270&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span>Of course, hindsight is a beautiful thing in trading, and this was most likely not going to be obvious at the time of those candlesticks forming. </span></p>
<p><span>Price then managed to break rapidly to the upside, emphasizing the fact that large institutions had many positions building up in this area. We know this because without large institutions and sizable positions, we would not have seen a move to the upside in such an aggressive fashion. </span></p>
<p><span>This example is showing a bullish order block. Conversely, if price had rapidly moved to the downside after the consolidation range, that would be considered to be a bearish order block. </span><span>When it comes to drawing the order block, there aren’t any tools or exact science that will be able to help you. In essence, you want to connect the highest point in the consolidation range and the lowest point in the range.  </span></p>
<h2><strong>How Can You Trade Forex Order Blocks? </strong></h2>
<p><span>Trading order blocks is a great way to build your trading bias. I’d highly recommend against just setting a pending buy/sell on order blocks, and recommend trying to just using the order blocks to steer your directional bias within the markets. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>What does this mean? </span></p>
<p><span>Here is a typical order block trade shown on USDJPY. We have an order block, inside an order block, here.</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-USDJPY-2.png?resize=624%2C280&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="280" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27068" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-USDJPY-2.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-USDJPY-2.png?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-USDJPY-2.png?resize=600%2C269&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> </span></p>
<p><span>On the 1H chart, there was an obvious/strong bearish order block forming, which contained another 15M order block. The 15M order block gave us a chance to dial into the trade and find a more specific level to be rejected. </span><span>Of course, we wouldn’t have known that an order block was being created at the time, so there was no real scope for taking a bearish order. However, when price came back to our order block, this is when a bearish opportunity presented itself.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-3.png?resize=624%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="624" height="281" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27070" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-3.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-3.png?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/luxtradingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orderblock-3.png?resize=600%2C270&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<p><span>As the order block was being rejected, we would need to start searching for bearish opportunities for entry. Luckily, there was a support level that had been rejected temporarily. </span><span>This provides an opportunity for us &#8211; if USDJPY can break below that level, that provides an opportunity for us to take a short. And </span><span>this is precisely what happened. With a fairly relaxed stop loss, you would have been walking out of this trade with a 1:2.6 RR. For a trader on a <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">funded trading account</a>, that would be a considerable profit. </span></p>
<p><span>Of course, this will not be the only method of entry for these trades. I would highly recommend back testing entry methods in order to <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2022/10/24/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges/">build a forex trading plan</a> for you to follow whilst trading. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Time Frames To Order Blocks Appear On?</strong></h2>
<p><span>In this article, I’ve shown you order blocks created on the daily time frame, the 15-minute and the 1-hour time frame. But </span><span>order blocks can be created on all time frames, even down to the 1-minute time frame. It’s worth noting that you’re going to see large pip moves from an order block created on a higher time frame. </span><span>Don’t expect a 1-minute order block to provide a 500 pip win, it’s very unlikely. </span></p>
<p><span>In terms of actually trading order blocks profitability, human error and decision-making will play a giant role in your success. If you’re trading the 1-minute time frame, you aren’t allowing yourself much time to make the correct decision and fully analyze the technical and fundamental aspects of your trade. </span><span>To that end, giving yourself more time to analyze, follow your trading plan and manage your risk appropriately is the best port of call and this will usually lead you to a higher time frame. </span></p>
<p><strong>In Summary &#8211; What Are Order Blocks, And How Can You Trade Them?</strong></p>
<p><span>In summary, order blocks are areas of high orders being placed by institutions and large trading firms, large enough to move the price of a currency pair. </span><span>These areas can be exploited by traders using the simple logic that if institutions are buying/selling at that price, you should be riding their coattails and doing the same thing! </span></p>
<p><span>This is a popular trading strategy used by some of our <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/lux-elite-traders-club/">funded traders</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>As a forex trader, the strategies you use within the markets will be a huge contributing factor to the success you have, or don’t have, within the markets. </span><span>Although psychology, risk management and other factors are important, without a trading strategy that is profitable over the long term, you’re just going to be spinning your wheels. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>There are 4 main trading strategies that many traders attempt. These strategies need to be avoided:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Martingale</li>
<li>Grid</li>
<li>News</li>
<li>No Strategy</li>
</ol>
<p><span>In this article, we are going to look at these 4 strategies and discuss exactly why you should not be considering these if you’re serious about <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">becoming a funded trader</a>. </span><span>So, let’s get into it…</span></p>
<p><strong>The 4 Trading Strategies You Need To Avoid As A Funded Trader</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="960" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQj4yB7xVBU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When newbie traders are learning the ropes, it’s easy to get hooked into trading with strategies that seem appealing. Typically, these strategies will be great at generating short-term returns, but much less appealing over the long term. </span><span>This rings true for all 4 of the trading strategies we are going to look at below… </span></p>
<p><span>There needs to be a pinch of salt taken with what I am saying here. Is it possible to make money with a grid trading strategy or a news-trading strategy? Well, of course, but it’s very unlikely. </span></p>
<p><span>To give yourself the best chance of <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/#howwillyougrow">becoming a funded trader</a> and keeping your funded trading account, it’s important to utilize proven and profitable strategies within the markets. </span></p>
<p><span>So, let’s take a look at the strategies you need to be avoiding. </span></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Martingale Trading Strategies</strong></p>
<p><span>Martingale is a very popular&#8221;strategy&#8221;, commonly used among gamblers in casinos. The logic is simple. Every time you take a loss, you double the position size. This means that if you have a losing streak, your position size is now so large, you will win just one position to get back to break even. </span><span>Although this sounds like an outstanding plan, you would need millions in liquidity to be able to pull this off. For most traders, it would only take between 6–10 losses to completely destroy your account balance. </span><span>You also need to consider the fact that this will not be an acceptable risk management strategy for any funded trading account &#8211; meaning you will have to use your own trading capital. </span></p>
<p><span>Martingale strategies can create a very nice equity curve, until you hit a losing streak. By back testing any trading system, you’ll soon realize that all systems will hit a losing streak at some point. </span></p>
<p><span>Many profitable trading systems even have periods of losing 15–20 trades in a row, during turbulent market conditions. </span></p>
<p><span>When looking at EA’s and algorithms within the market, most of the time, the developers will just run the back test until they know a losing streak will occur. At that point, they upload the perfect equity curve to MQL5 and lure newbie traders into purchasing the system! </span><span>Regardless of your entry points and exit strategies, using Martingale is a sure fire way to lose all of your account balance in a matter of days. We have written a full article about <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2023/01/22/building-a-trading-bot-to-pass-a-prop-firm-challenge/">EA trading</a> which may be of interest. </span></p>
<p><strong>2. Grid Trading Strategies </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>Grid trading strategies are also very common among algorithmic and EA traders. This involves setting a large amount of pending market orders, both buys and sells, in a grid pattern across the chart. </span><span>For instance, a grid of 10 pips could be used. This would mean that trades are set in 10 pip intervals up and down in the market of choice. </span><span>On its own, this doesn’t provide any kind of edge in the markets. Many traders aim to combine this entry method with other price action or analysis efforts to give themselves an edge in the markets. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>However, it’s a lot easier said than done. </span></p>
<p><span>Opening so many trades leads to huge draw-downs. When the market pushes against you, it can push against your buy and your sell orders, depending on how you’ve structured your orders and how the market is behaving. </span><span>This leads to massive draw-downs, something that is a huge problem for funded traders. Not only that, opening that many trades causes you to suffer from ‘death by a thousand cuts’. </span><span>Each position opened has a fee attached to it, whether paid from commission or spread. This makes it very expensive to open so many positions, especially if you’re only taking a few pips per position. </span><span>There is certainly utility in grid trading methodology, but this shouldn’t be approached by novice traders. Much like with Martingale strategies, this can provide a great-looking equity curve, until the losing streak hits, and your whole account will be wiped out in days. </span></p>
<p><strong>3. News Trading Strategies</strong></p>
<p><span>News trading is not for the faint-hearted. In minutes, you can turn an account from £100 to £1000, or £10,000 to £0. </span><span>For newbie traders, it sounds incredibly appealing because you can make the ‘fast money’ that all traders dream of. However, this is much less of a reality in principle. </span><span>Why? </span></p>
<p><span>Well, news releases are typically priced into the markets days before they are released. If a piece of news comes out that is supposedly good news, you’ll notice that the market doesn’t fly in that direction. </span><span>Likewise, bad news doesn’t always get the price of currencies moving in the direction you would assume. Cynics would call this manipulation, but in reality, the price movement has already been priced into the market by institutions. </span><span>With that being said, it’s certainly possible to make profits with news trading. However, you cannot be a novice trader to pull this off. It takes a huge amount of experience to consistently make this work, without giving all of your money back to the markets. </span><span>You need to be hyper aware of spreads and the liquidity during these news releases. In your terms of service with a broker, it’ll mention the fact that they will strive to fill you at the closest price to your stop losses, entries and take profits. </span><span>This doesn’t guarantee that they will actually meet that demand. </span><span>When news is released, spreads can go from 0.1 pips to 20 pips and traders get stopped out of positions, taking on a huge amount of additional loss than ever planned. </span><span>I’d highly recommend that you avoid <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2023/01/09/trading-the-news-as-a-forex-trader/">trading news</a> if you’re serious about getting funded. </span></p>
<p><strong> 4. N</strong><strong>ot Having A Trading Strategy</strong></p>
<p><span>One of the worst trading strategies you can run with is not having a strategy at all. This is very common among newbie traders. Saying that, I’ve even met traders with years of market exposure under their belt that don’t have a set trading strategy in place. </span><span>This is appealing to some traders. Not being shackled by the objective rules of a strategy. Being able to take trades whenever you fancy. Not answering to a trading plan. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>However, this simply isn’t realistic. </span></p>
<p><span>Humans are not wired to be successful traders because we are too emotional. Even if you’re a professional standard trader, you will succumb to emotions in the markets &#8211; fear and greed. </span><span>These two emotions will cause you to hold trades too long, close trades early, take trades you shouldn’t take and sit out of trades you should be taking. </span><span>I’ve seen this happen time and time again… A trader back tests a strategy, and it’s a profitable/viable strategy. They then apply this manually to the live markets and get slapped by losses.</span><span>Why?</span></p>
<p><span>Because they aren’t following the plan, or they don’t even have a plan! </span><span>Without an objective plan in place, it’s impossible to analyze whether your trading strategy is actually profitable. Without knowing this, you’re wasting your time and money and ultimately may never be successful as a forex trader. </span><span>For these reasons, it’s so important to <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com/2022/10/24/how-to-create-a-bulletproof-trading-plan-to-pass-prop-firm-challenges/">build a robust trading plan for becoming a funded trader</a>. </span></p>
<h2><strong>In Summary &#8211; What Trading Strategies Should You Avoid As A Funded Trader? </strong></h2>
<p><span>In conclusion, I’d highly recommend avoiding these 4 risky trading strategies if you’re looking to obtain forex prop firm funding. </span><span>Of course, take this with a pinch of salt. Traders are making profits using all 4 of these strategies, but they’re most likely well-experienced, and certainly the minority. </span></p>
<p><span>To give yourself the best chance of success, use robust, tested objective systems in your trading and throw away the gambling mentality. </span><span>Are you looking to get funded? Work with <a href="https://luxtradingfirm.com">Lux Trading Firm</a> now! </span></p>
