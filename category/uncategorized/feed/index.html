<p>Forex traders rely on certain basic strategies to make a profit on international markets. These forex trading strategies are easy to learn but difficult to master. Take a look at some of the major forex trading strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="scalping">Scalping</h3>



<p>Scalping is a forex trading strategy that involves making small profits with multiple trades. You can set the entry and exit positions with minor changes in the currencies to achieve low margins. Scalping needs precise execution to make the most of your trades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are short-term trades that can last anywhere between 1 to 60 minutes. Being well-informed about currency trends is crucial to successful scalping.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="day-trading">Day trading</h3>



<p>As the name suggests, day trading involves opening and closing a trade on the same day. These trades can take place anywhere between a few minutes to a couple of hours. This way you can avoid running through unprecedented losses due to overnight price volatility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re new to forex trading, day trading is a simple and straightforward method to start earning. It can limit your risk while improving your chances of profitability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="swing-trading">Swing trading</h3>



<p>Swing trading is a strategy that involves trading forex currencies over a day or a week. This method gives you plenty of time to deflect daily ups and downs in the value of currency pairs. You can skip through needless stop losses along the way with this medium-term forex trading strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="position-trading">Position trading</h3>



<p>Position trading is a strategy that involves holding your trade positions open for the long term. These trades can take place anywhere between a week to several months or even years. This method lets you take advantage of major shifts in the value of currency pairs without stressing over micro changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can set the entry and exit positions for lengthier durations with position trading. Keeping a watchful eye over current events and socio-economic policies that affect the world at large is key to making this type of trading work. You can casually sign-in to your account once or twice a week.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="range-trading">Range trading</h3>



<p>Range trading is a strategy that involves predictable price movements of currency pairs. This method relies on historical performance data of currency pairs to identify repeating patterns of lows and highs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the financial data, you can set a wider entry and exit position to capitalize on previous price trends. With the calculated risks involved, it is a safer alternative to day trading.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="forex-trading-example-in-india">Forex Trading Example in India</h2>



<p>Let’s say the USD/INR is trading at 74.6350. If you’re expecting the value of USD to rise in a few hours, you can buy 100,000 units of USD. In this case, you’ll need 7,463,500 INR deposited in your account to complete the transaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 3 hours, the value of the U.S. dollar against the Indian Rupee rises to 75.0000. You can immediately sell the $100,000 you bought and make a profit of 36,500 INR (7,500,000 – 7,463,500) within a single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="making-money-with-forex-in-india">Making Money with Forex in India</h2>



<p>The biggest hurdle you’ll face when trading Indian forex is the limited number of foreign currencies. Indian residents can only trade forex pairs with the INR in it. But the USD/INR is a popular currency pair with an attractive return rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Historically, the USD has been proven to grow stronger in value over the years. Considering the recent performance, the 52-week low for the USD is 68.2900 while the 52-week high is 76.9163. You can leverage the broad range of price movements to make tremendous profits in the short and long-term.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="forex-terminology">Forex Terminology</h2>



<p>Millions of people trade forex every day. For successful forex trading, learn these basic terms before you get started.</p>



<p><strong>Pip:&nbsp;</strong>the smallest unit of price movement in a currency pair. Forex pairs are usually listed to the 4<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>decimal point. For instance, if the USD/INR has moved from 74.6535 to 74.6545, it is considered a rise of 10 pips.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lot size:&nbsp;</strong>the total number of currency units bought or sold. 100,000 units is the standard lot size but you can trade lesser units as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Orders:&nbsp;</strong>an order lets you execute the trade.For instance, if you want to buy 100 USD/INR, you execute a buy order. Similarly, if you want to sell 100 USD/INR, you execute a sell order. There are different types of orders to help you minimize losses and maximize profits.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Calls:&nbsp;</strong>a call is sent out by your online broker when your trade positions need additional funding to be maintained. You should constantly check your account for any calls you may have received to avoid further losses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="trade-forex-in-india">Trade Forex in India</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-forex-broker-in-india/">Indian forex</a>&nbsp;is an untapped market with great potential. INR currencies pairs such as the USD/INR and EUR/INR can offer a spike of up to 1,000 pips within a few weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trading Indian forex can reward your patience with profitable returns in the long run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India is a land of diverse cultures and a growing economy. Foreign exchange (forex) trading in India is an emerging platform with exciting opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be part of action and learn to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/forex-trading-for-beginners/">trade forex</a>&nbsp;with our guide to forex in India.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="get-started-with-forex-in-india">Get Started with Forex in India</h2>



<p>Forex trading is not entirely legal in India. You are only allowed to trade currency pairs that include the Indian Rupee (INR). The primary reason behind this restriction is that the INR is weak against the U.S. dollar (USD). Traders from India who want to buy the USD have to purchase it from the Central Bank of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a citizen of India, you can trade&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/stocks-vs-forex/">forex</a>&nbsp;on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE). Established in 1992, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/about-sebi.html">Securities and Exchange Board of India</a>&nbsp;(SEBI) was set up to monitor and regulate forex activity in India. It is an autonomous authority that protects forex securities issuers, investors and forex-related agencies. Forex brokers and stock exchanges must be licensed by SEBI to operate within India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to get serious about trading forex in India? Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-1-get-a-digital-device-with-fast-internet-connectivity">Step 1: Get a digital device with fast Internet connectivity.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can use your desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone to trade forex. The value of the currency pairs listed on the stock exchanges frequently fluctuate. A personal device to constantly track these changes is essential to successful forex trading.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-2-find-an-online-forex-broker">Step 2: Find an online forex broker.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There are several forex brokers available online. Go through each broker’s website and choose 1 that allows you to trade INR currency pairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be sure to check the footer of every website for information on the regulatory bodies. If you can’t find any such information from the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or similar regulatory bodies, the broker can’t be trusted.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-3-sign-up-for-an-account">Step 3: Sign-up for an account.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can open a new account with the forex broker on its website. Some forex brokers require a minimum amount of deposit to open an account. These brokers also offer different kinds of accounts based on your financial goals. Choose the 1 that’s right for you.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-4-transfer-funds-to-your-account">Step 4: Transfer funds to your account.</h3>



<p>Once you’ve signed up for an account, you need to transfer funds to start trading forex. Depending on the broker you’ve chosen, you can choose your native currency and fund your account using several options. Generally, these funding options include bank transfers, wire transfers and debit cards.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-5-download-a-forex-trading-platform">Step 5: Download a forex trading platform.</h3>



<p>You need to download the forex trading platform on your computer or smartphone. Take the time to customize the look and feel of the platform to help you maximize forex trading opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-6-begin-your-forex-trading-journey">Step 6: Begin your forex trading journey.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Before you start trading forex, you might want to run a few demos using virtual money. These demos can help you get used to the interface of the forex broker without conceding unnecessary losses. After you feel confident using the platform, you can start trading forex using real money.</p>

<p>The Indian forex trading industry offers immense potential for earning huge profits. INR, when paired with other currencies such as USD and EUR can provide attractive returns with an increase of almost 1000 pips in just a couple of weeks. In other words, when it comes to trading forex in India, you need to be patient to earn profitable returns and rewards in the long-term.<br>In this article, learn everything you need to know about forex trading in India.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is Forex Trading? How is Forex Trading done in India?</strong></h2>



<p>Similar to stocks, one can sell or buy forex currencies based on what they think would be their value in the short or long-run. Often, traders strategize and speculate the value of a currency and where it is likely to head in the long-term to earn attractive gains. However, given the highly volatile nature of the market, you must create a well-thought-out plan before trading forex in India.</p>



<p>Thus,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.platinumtradingacademy.com/start-trading-forex/">Forex trading</a>, also known as currency trading or foreign exchange trading, is essentially a decentralized global market, wherein all the foreign currencies from across the globe are traded, bought, and sold. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market#:~:text=The%20foreign%20exchange%20market%20(Forex,exchange%20rates%20for%20every%20currency.&amp;text=The%20foreign%20exchange%20market%20works,and%20operates%20on%20several%20levels.">forex trading market</a>&nbsp;is a highly liquid and largest market in the globe. The daily average trading volume of the market amounts to nearly 5 trillion dollars.</p>



<p>In essence, forex trading India-wide takes place when a trader buys and sells one currency in exchange for another as part of one single transaction. The two forex currencies that are involved in one transaction are referred to as the currency pair.</p>



<p>In India, forex currency trading has gained a great deal of attention and momentum over the past couple of decades. It is carried out through the BSE i.e. Bombay Stock Exchange, NSE i.e. National Stock Exchange, as well as Multi-Commodity Exchange Stock Exchange. So, if you are wondering how forex trading works in India, then you must know that it has become an emerging platform for trading a wide range of currency pairs. Investors looking to earn profits rely on forex trading in India to make profits as a result of price fluctuations.</p>



<p>The duration for trading currencies in the Indian market is between 9 am to 5 pm. Traders are not required to have cash or equity for trading currencies. Also, traders can trade futures and options when it comes to forex trading in India.</p>



<p>It must be noted that trading currencies weren&#8217;t a huge deal in the country before future derivatives were introduced in the world of forex. While forex currency trading in India was available to corporates and banks earlier, the future derivatives market was opened up for individual investors later. With liberalization, it became easier to hold and trade currencies, particularly for banks and corporates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Forex Trading Legal?</strong></h2>



<p>Is forex trading in India legal? Well, forex currency trading is considered legal in India when an individual carries it out via specific forex trading platforms as well as INR remains the base currency. In other words, the government of India has restricted trading for its residents to only those currencies that have been bench-marked against the INR.</p>



<p>As a resident of India, if you choose to trade via any specific Indian Brokerage and accessing exchanges like BSE, MCX-SX, and NSE that offer access to forex currency derivatives, the transactions carried out are all considered to be entirely legal. Before this, the only currencies that were offered were GBP/INR, EUR/INR, USD/INR as well as JPY/INR. But the RBI, from the 10th of December 2015, allowed financial exchanges to provide cross-currency futures as well as exchange-traded options in 3 other currency pairs including, GBP-USD, USD-JPY, and EUR-USD.</p>



<p>Since there isn&#8217;t any equity or cash form like in the case of the stock market in India, traders must create their trading accounts with a reputed broker for conducting forex trading in India.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategies for Forex Trading in India</strong></h2>



<p>Given that the forex trading in India is highly liquid (in terms of daily volume traded), it can be risky, and hence one can lose money quickly. However, if investors create and stick to their forex trading strategies, then earning profits won&#8217;t be too difficult. Below, take a look at some of the strategies for forex trading in India.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Price Action:</strong>&nbsp;This is one of the most common strategies used by traders in the country. It is entirely dependent on the bears or bulls of the pricing action in forex currency trading as well as is useful in different market conditions.<br></li><li><strong>Trend Trading:</strong>&nbsp;This trading strategy requires traders to identify any movement (whether downward or upward) of the forex currency price. Based on this price, they must decide their point of entry. Also, online tools like stochastic, moving average, relative strength indicators, etc. are all available that help traders to better analyze market trends.<br></li><li><strong>Counter Trend:</strong>&nbsp;In this particular strategy, trade is carried out against the existing trend to earn small profits. It is based on the speculation or prediction that market trend will likely reserve.<br></li><li><strong>Range Trading:</strong>&nbsp;In this strategy, trades are carried out in a particular range of forex currency prices. This strategy helps in identifying the suitable price conditions for trading, wherein the pricing levels are based on the supply and demand for the forex currencies.<br></li><li><strong>Breakout Trading:</strong>&nbsp;In this particular strategy, traders enter the market at a point when the currency market is coming out of the previous forex trading range i.e. breakout.<br></li><li><strong>Position Trading:</strong>&nbsp;This particular strategy is utilized by the professional and veteran traders and revolves around analyzing the forex charts after the day has concluded. One must have a solid understanding of the market fundamentals to master this strategy.<br></li><li><strong>Carry Trade:</strong>&nbsp;In the carry trade strategy, the emphasis is mostly on the difference in the rate of interest of the nations whose forex currency is selected for trading. This entails selling the currency that has a low rate of interest and purchasing the one that has a high rate of interest. Hence, it can be a successful strategy when executed appropriately.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who is eligible to trade in Currency Futures markets in India?</strong></h2>



<p>When it comes to forex trading in India, any citizen residing within the nation&#8217;s territory or a firm including, financial institutions, as well as banks, can take part in the currency futures market. But, FIIs or Foreign Institutional Investors, as well as NRIs or Non-Resident Indians, are restricted from taking part in the futures market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Forex trading profitable in India?</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian economy is quite strong and offers the immense business potential to numerous international brands, owing to its market size and sound financial market. Given the existing scenario, forex currency trading is undoubtedly profitable in India. It offers traders with tremendous scope to earn profits through the trading of currencies</p>



<p>However, the forex trading sector is highly volatile, and in the absence of a clear strategy, one can end up incurring losses. This is why it is important to acquire appropriate skillsets for trading. Another important thing about the Indian forex trading market is that with the introduction of derivatives, currency trading has witnessed major growth in India. It opened up the world of trading for investors and individuals, which was earlier restricted only to large corporates and banks. Also, liberalization gave a boost to currency trading further, allowing both corporations and banks much flexibility in trading as well as holding currencies.</p>



<p>One of the advantages of forex trading in India is available in the form of margin trading. One can trade currencies for huge profits with only a small amount of deposit. The margin needed for trading 1 lot of the USD/INR in the National Stock Exchange is nearly 1500 INR that accounts for almost 2.5% of the total investment.</p>



<p>So, if you are keen about forex trading in India, then you must conduct an in-depth market analysis before trading currencies forex as well as investing your money in them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which currency pairs can be traded in India?</strong></h2>



<p>As already stated earlier, the Indian government allows investors to trade only the below-mentioned currency pairs:</p>



<ul><li>Rupee-pound</li><li>Rupee-dollar</li><li>Rupee-euro</li><li>Rupee-yen</li><li>Pound-dollar</li><li>Yen-dollar</li><li>Euro-dollar</li></ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>In a nutshell, to achieve success in forex trading in India, traders must get their basics right. It is equally important that they focus on their goals as well as risk management strategies to earn desired profits. Investors must assess their trading style before making any trading decision. Also, forex trading enthusiasts need to assess their risk profile before they make any investment. Another thing to bear in mind is the choice of the right platform or broker. Remember, having a reputed broker for trading is crucial for success.</p>



<p>A broker will not only handhold you but also provide you with updated live forex market news apart from helping you to open a forex trading account in India. Lastly, traders must know their limits before they jump into any trade. They must specify the exit and entry points for trade as well as leave the market when the conditions are not favorable.</p>



<p>Remember, like any other form of trading, the currency market has its own set of risks, and therefore one should never trade with borrowed funds or think of stretching themselves. Also, on certain days investors will end up placing several winning trades, and on other days they may end up having more losing trades in their portfolio. It is only ideal that traders learn from their mistakes and create the best strategies for profitable trading..</p>
